# Introduction

Welcome to the universe of Plerion, where adventure and danger await in the depths of space. The Five Galaxies is parte of a series of booklets that will guide you through the wonders and perils of this universe.

In addition to the Core Rules are also available _Solo Starfarer_, a solitaire game supplement, and _The Book of Cosmic Creatures_ a bestiary with nearly 200 alien monsters to populate your adventures.

In this booklet, we will take a closer look at the geography and history of the Five Galaxies. From the bustling trade routes of Charted Space to the uncharted expanses of the oddspace, we will explore the worlds and systems that make up this universe.

From the ancient and powerful civilizations that span multiple galaxies, to the small independent nations that struggle to survive on the fringes of Charted Space, the universe of Plerion is full of intrigue and conflict.

Get ready to embark on an epic space opera adventure, where you will encounter strange and wondrous creatures, explore the ruins of lost civilizations, and face the challenges of life in the depths of space.

## A brief overview

Plerion is set in a vast and dynamic universe where humanity shares the stars with numerous alien species. The known universe is divided into five galaxies, each with its own unique history, cultures, and conflicts.

At the heart of Plerion’s universe is the ability to travel faster than light through a dimension called oddspace. This discovery opened the door to interstellar travel, allowing civilizations to explore and colonize the galaxy. The Five Galaxies of Plerion are home to countless star systems, planets, habitats, and space stations, each with their own dangers and opportunities.

Humans are not the only species in Plerion, and they are not the most prominent. The galaxy is home to numerous alien species, some of which are as old as the galaxies themselves. Extinct species have left behind artifacts and lost technologies that can be found in ruins and archaeological sites. The multiculturalism of known space generates both growth and conflict, with great empires covering vast territories and small independent nations fighting to maintain their sovereignty.

Charting the galaxy is profitable, with governments and organizations willing to pay well for data on new targets and territories. Fast travel is possible through natural and artificial wormholes, which reduce the time it takes to traverse the vast expanses of space between clusters. The Charted Space is dotted with military, commercial, and industrial stations that form the nodes of the travel network.

Venturing out on a mission in Plerion is a risky business that involves facing uncharted expanses, landing on unknown planets facing their alien cultures, or facing the dangers of abandoned installations or derelict ships. Spacers have different ways of making profit, but all of them are risky. Paramilitary and mercenary missions are a great source of income, while interstellar trade, search for artifacts, and exploration missions are other common activities of spacers.

Despite the dangers, starfaring travel in Plerion is as common as traveling by plane nowadays, with planets, regions, and nations communicating and trading through routes discovered continuously through oddspace. Due to the limited capacity of fuel tanks, it is commonly recommended to trace routes that end travel in well-known star systems, or at least in one served by a base to refuel.

The sidereal space is vast and dangerous, and out there, you are almost always alone. In case of trouble, nobody is likely to help you. Alien creatures, pathogens, and unfamiliar technology are the order of the day in uncharted regions. The Charted Space is not so well-known, and there are billions of unknown systems waiting to be explored and exploited.

In Plerion, technology is not all at the same level in Charted Space, and it varies by country/species and from core to fringe of each one. Exporting advanced technology is profitable but can cause severe problems. Interspecies relationships are complex, with cosmopolitanism being a dominant trait of empires and distrust or xenophobia of smaller nations. Spacers are usually open and welcoming and have no problem working with people of other species.

## Introducing the Five Galaxies

The Five Galaxies refer to the Local Group of galaxies, which spans over three million light-years in diameter. The Local Group is a cluster of galaxies that includes the Milky Way, Andromeda, Triangulum, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, and many smaller galaxies and clusters.

To humans, these galaxies are known by these names, but other species may use different names. In the Sidereal Year 5.151.267 (7.396 CE), the main species that inhabit this region of space are the Lynem, Che-esune, Tesu, Wrulisu, Omale, and Hetsu. Humans are also present, but they are a minor species in this region.

The Conglomerate of Sol is the human nation with Earth at its center and spans a fraction of Orion’s Arm in the Milky Way. The Conglomerate has established outposts and colonies in various locations in the Five Galaxies and beyond, but their influence is limited compared to other species.

Each of the Five Galaxies has its unique characteristics and inhabitants, and they are interconnected through a network of wormholes and hyperlanes. The Andromeda galaxy is the largest and most familiar of the Five Galaxies, and it is home to a diverse array of species and civilizations. Andromeda is the closest galaxy to the Milky Way, which is also home to many advanced species.

Triangulum is a smaller galaxy, but it is home to some of the most ancient and advanced species in the Local Group. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are dwarf galaxies that orbit the Milky Way and are home to some unique species that are not found elsewhere in the Local Group.

Despite their differences, the Five Galaxies are interconnected through trade, diplomacy, and conflict. Many species have formed alliances and federations to protect their interests and maintain peace and stability in the region. However, the emergence of new threats and the shifting balance of power have created a volatile and unpredictable situation in the Five Galaxies.
