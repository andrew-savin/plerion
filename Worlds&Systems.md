# Worlds & Systems

## Astrography

The enormous expanses that access to oddspace has made traversable have generated the need to map the vastness of the Five Galaxies. 
Normal space is subdivided into 10pc-sided cubes, called neighborhoods. 

Below is the conventional scale in which the Charted Space is subdivided:
- **Neighborhood**: A portion of 10pc<sup>3</sup> space in which there are several star systems.
- **Sector**: A portion of 100pc<sup>3</sup> or 100 neighborhoods. 
- **Region**: A portion of 1000pc<sup>3</sup> or 100 sectors or 10000 neighborhoods.
- **Quadrant**: A quarter of a galaxy, containing several regions each.

There is an additional informal grouping called cluster. Clusters are portions of space of 100pc radius from a wormhole access.  Because natural wormholes are randomly located in space, clusters often overlap with sectors.

Neighborhoods are represented for convenience in two-dimensional maps on the plane of the star system at the center. Neighborhood maps are divided into hexagonal grids of 1pc pitch. On major scales, sector maps have 10pc pitch, and region maps have 100pc pitch, each hex representing 10 hexes of the lower scale.
