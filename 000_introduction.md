Intrepid spacers ply the vastness of the Five Galaxies in search of fortune and glory. 

This is **Plerion**, a sci-fi hack from [*Cairn*](https://cairnrpg.com) designed to play radiant space opera.

Inspired by classic science fiction and the RPGs that emulate it, but with a more modern twist, winking at transhumanism and cyberpunk.

*Plerion* is an adventure game for one **referee** and at least one other player.
Players act as hardened spacers exploring, exploiting and commerce through the vastness of space in the far future.

- Classic Traveller
- Jack Vance's Gaen Reach
- Mass Effect
- Becky Chambers's Wayfarer Series
- David Brin's Uplift Series
