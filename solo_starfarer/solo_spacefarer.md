# Plerion - Solo Spacefarer

*I cautiously approach the derelict, anchoring my spaceship to the
deformed scaffolding with a slight, eerie creaking sound. As I cross the
threshold, I sense a feeling of unease, as if time itself has frozen in
this place.*

*The corridors are dark and dusty, illuminated only by faint red glows
from damaged control panels. Cables hang from the ceiling, and the sound
of my breathing is the only audible noise. I move cautiously, examining
every detail of the derelict. Every now and then, I hear a distant
whisper, a ghostly echo from a long-forgotten past.*

*As I traverse a narrow corridor, I feel an odd tremor coming from the
floor. I drop to my knees as the ground beneath me opens into a chasm. I
manage to stifle the sudden sensation of vertigo, reaching out and
grasping onto a protrusion. Slowly, I pull myself up and continue my
exploration with even greater care.*

*Further ahead, I reach a semi-destroyed control room. The screens
flicker intermittently, displaying distorted images and incomprehensible
codes. I manage to retrieve some encrypted files that might contain
valuable information about the ship's past, but deciphering them will be
a challenge.*

*Continuing my journey, I encounter mysterious creatures, blurry shadows
that seem to move in the corners. I'm unsure whether they are survivors
of the original crew or beings that appeared after the derelict was
abandoned. Regardless of their origin, I remain calm and ensure I avoid
their sinister gaze.*

*After hours of exploration, I reach the main cargo hold. The atmosphere
is thick with tension, as rays of sunlight filter through the cracks in
the ceiling. As I scrutinize the debris, I discover an intriguing
object: a mysterious luminescent sphere. I approach it cautiously,
extending my hand to touch it.*

*As my fingers brush against the sphere, an intense glow envelops me. I
suddenly feel as if I've been catapulted into another dimension. Visions
flash before me rapidly, fragments of past lives and unknown futures.*

*But when the glow fades, I find myself back in the cargo hold,
bewildered and perplexed. The luminescent sphere has vanished, leaving
behind only a sense of loss and an unsolved enigma. What did that vision
mean? What was the derelict hiding?*

*I don't have time to reflect further, as suddenly the derelict begins
to shake violently. Debris detaches from the walls and fills the
corridors, and the deafening sound startles me. With a frantic dash, I
run toward my spaceship, hoping to reach it before everything
collapses.*

# Intro

Welcome to *Solo Starfarer*. This booklet serves as a companion to
*Plerion*, the Space Opera Adventure Game based on Cairn. To make use of
these additional rules, **you'll require the Core Book**.

Here, you won't find information on character creation, combat, or
equipment.

Within these pages, you'll discover suggested approaches and procedures,
but consider them as flexible guidelines. All its components are modules
that you can "turn on or off" according to your taste. After all, this
is your game\! Do you wish to chart the vast reaches of interstellar
space? Use the Exploration Procedure and the Star System Generation
tables. Interested in scavenging a derelict vessel adrift in the cosmos?
Employ the Installations Generator and embark on your exploration. Fancy
venturing into speculative trading? Why not\!

The only limit is your imagination. Here, we offer you a structural
framework for those moments when inspiration may be lacking to kickstart
your adventure.

## What Is a Solo Role-Playing Game?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the
roles of imaginary characters and take actions and make decisions within
an imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is
often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as rolling
dice or using measurable character attributes.

In a solo role-playing game, a single player takes on the roles of one
or more characters while simultaneously managing certain elements of the
game world. These games typically involve the use of a rules system and
game mechanics to determine the outcomes of the actions taken by the
player-controlled characters.

Through the interaction between the player, oracle, tools, and prompts,
the character's actions will build an emerging narrative in which almost
anything can be attempted, with no predetermined limits.

If you are not familiar with Solo-RPGs, here are some excellent
introductory guides you can use to gain some insight:

  - *Solo Roleplaying: A brief introduction* by Alex Yari
    <https://t.ly/oM_l6>
  - *Solo RPG Basics* <https://t.ly/f62eq>

If you want to try something simpler before embarking on a modular,
procedural game like this, Zotiquest Games published *Loner*, a very
light Solo-RPG written with beginners in mind. It's free\!

## Kickstart Your Adventure

If you've never played an RPG or even a solo RPG before, you might be
wondering what to do\! Here are some guidelines to kickstart your
adventure:

1.  **Create a Character:** Before beginning the game, create your
    character following the core rules.
2.  **Choose a Path:** will give you a role, additional resources and
    more background to immerse yourself in the game universe.
3.  **Starting Planet:** Start your adventure on a home planet, where
    you can stock up on supplies and items essential for your journey.
    The planet can be used as a starting point to explore the starry
    expanses. It doesn't need elaborate details; a simple outpost with a
    spaceport and a store will suffice. Perhaps a small colony with a
    bar.
4.  **Explore the Starry Expanse:** Start venturing among the stars in
    search of fortune\!
5.  **Combat:** If you encounter an enemy, prepare for battle. Use your
    statistics and skills to defeat the foe.
6.  **Solving Puzzles and Challenges:** During the game, you might come
    across puzzles and challenges that need to be solved. Use your
    cleverness and skills to overcome them and reap rewards.
7.  **Acquiring Items and Wealth:** Throughout your adventure, you may
    find useful items such as weapons, armor, and supplies. Collect
    anything that might be handy for your journey and keep track of your
    inventory.
8.  **Character Advancement:** As you progress in the game, your
    character will grow and evolve. This involves not only increasing
    your stats, but also acquiring new equipment, wealth and reputation.
9.  **Choices and Consequences:** Remember that your choices will
    influence the outcome of your adventure. Be mindful of what you
    choose and how you act, as it could have significant consequences
    for your journey.
10. **End of the Adventure:** You can play a single session or a
    campaign. You decide when to stop. From your actions and how the
    game world reacts, missions, unexpected goals, and relationships
    with Non-Player Characters will emerge. There are no predetermined
    limits: perhaps your character will rise to fame and glory or meet a
    gruesome end in a haunted derelict. Play to find out\!

# Game Procedures

The following procedures will help you give structure to your solitaire
game. You do not neet to follow them. Use them only if they are helpful
and adapt them where you feel it is necessary.

## Ground Procedures

Follow this procedure when a PC lands on a new planet. If you do not own
a ship skip the first step.

  - **Maintenance:** Pay ship costs and crew salaries. If needed, make
    repairs to the ship (if you can afford it).
  - **Take Action**: Each day you stay in a safe haven you can perform
    *one* of the following actions.
      - **Medical Care:** Treat injuries or pay for medical assistance.
      - **Look for a job:** if you need it, look for a job on the local
        spaceport assignment lists. Use the Job Generator to find out
        what's available.
      - **Listen to rumors:** you might listen to some rumors by
        eavesdropping among the docks or in the local bar. Use the rumor
        generator if you need it.
      - **Find a patron:** if you are particularly ambitious or needy,
        you will need to seek a patron for an actual Mission. You have a
        1-in-6 chance per week of crossing paths with such an offer.
      - **Buy/Sell goods or equipment:** if you are a Carrier devoted to
        speculative trading, now is a good time to do your magic.
  - **Roll for Event:**

| 2D6  | Event                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-6  | Unfavorable encounter or Disaster (Roll for Spark) |
| 7    | Nothing                                            |
| 8-12 | Favorable Encounter or Fortune (Roll for Spark)    |

**Note:** Remember that staying overnight and eating cost money\! The
more days you stay in a landing without doing anything or failing to get
work, the thinner your finances will shrink.

## Exploring Space

Exploring the cosmos can be highly rewarding but very risky. If you
undertake a path from Pathfinder, use the following procedure.

  - **Roll a Star System:** if you are entering an unkwon region of
    space, use the Star System Generation (in the core book) to
    determine the feature of the next system.
  - **Take Action:** now you can perform *one* of the following per
    turn.
      - **Travel:** you can travel everywhere in the reach granted by
        the fuel reserve of your ship.
      - **Explore:** if you entered a star system, you can explore its
        celestial body in search for interesting features or sources of
        income.
      - **Interact:** if the planet is inhabited, you can decide to
        interact with its population by radio or by landing.
      - **Dock:** you can dock on a planet equipped with a spaceport.
      - **Refuel:** if necessary and you have access to a spaceport you
        can refuel within your finances.
  - **Roll for Event:**

| 2D6   | Event                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Ship malfunction (deactivate one module) |

| 4-6   | Pirates                      |
| 7     | Patrol                       |
| 8-10  | Freelancers                  |
| 11-12 | Star Leviathan               |

## Explore Installations

As Salvager you will find yourself exploring derelict ships and other
abandoned installations. Even in other paths you may find yourself
boarding and navigating installations that are still active. First use
the Installation Generator to determine Origin and Current Purpose. Then
follow the following procedure.

  - **Roll Area or Junction:** Use the relevant table to generate the
    current environment, its size, number of outputs and features.
  - **Roll for Event (see below):** check what happens, pulling on the
    event table-
  - **Take Action:** resolve the undertaken action.
      - If an encounter occurs use the reaction and possibly combat
        rules.
      - If you encounter a trap, use the Oracle and Saves to determine
        if you are affected.

| 2D6   | Event                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Exhaustion (need to rest)     |
| 4-6   | Trap                          |

3.  Decide on a ruling faction, with traits & motive (roll on the *NPC
    and Faction Generator*).
4.  Add some kind of counter balance (another faction, some kind of
    nefarious enemy, etc).

### Draw A Planetary Map

1.  Take a sheet of paper or a virtual canvas.
2.  Draw at least four lines of any shape, each from a different color.
    Each line should cross another at least once. These lines represent
    roads or paths.
3.  Generate at least 3 Points of Interest: take in consideration the
    theme(s) and factions. Put these wherever the lines cross.
4.  Generate regional features for each POI using tables and placing
    results in those POIs where it makes most sense.
5.  Place additional (especially hidden) dangers, encounters or NPC’s in
    some of the POI.
6.  Add some travel/route complications, taking in consideration any
    POIs along the way.

### Create Encounters

1.  Make an encounter table (either 1d6 or 2d6), with at least one
    result tied to the party or its members.
2.  Details on any Artifact (Who wants it? Where is it now? Why wasn’t
    it ransacked before?). Include maps.
3.  Roll area/junction for an installation.

You do not need to do this for ever single POI, only those that interest
you.

# Tuning Characters and Combat for Solo play

Plerion's core rules are designed for a group of characters facing
dangers together. By venturing as loners into interstellar space, the
risks increase and death is a much bleaker omen.

To make your character more durable, without betraying the Old School
style of this game, here are a couple of viable options:

1.  **Enhanced Character** (for lone spacers only):
    1.  When you generate the character, he is automatically assigned 6
        HP, without the need to pull it.
    2.  When damage is rolled, a d4 "Enhanced Die" is added.
    3.  When a Save is rolled instead, the Enhanced Die is subtracted
        from the total.
    4.  When the character wants to escape, make a DEX Save. On a
        success, the PC manages to escape from combat.
2.  **Use assistants**:
    1.  *Instead of the Enhanced Character* option, automatically assign
        one or two companions (following the creation rules in the core
        book).
    2.  Assistants have a background (drawn randomly on the relevant
        table) that will be able to guarantee any situational
        advantages.
    3.  This type of assistant has a monthly salary of 1,000 credits
        each. Take this into account in your finances.
    4.  Assistants have no funds or inventory management (assume they
        have a weapon and items needed for the current mission). You can
        equip them with a more powerful weapon if you have purchased it
        and are not using it.
    5.  When you ask them to do something risky or potentially lethal,
        they perform a WIL Save. If they fail, they will refuse to
        comply and potentially could quit.

# Resolve Uncertainty

In a solo game you will have to manage your character and the game world
at the same time. But you're not writing a novel\! Subverting your
expectations and being surprised by the unpredictability of the shots is
an integral part of this style of play. Here you will find an Oracle and
other tools to help you introduce and manage the uncertainty of actions.
The Oracle is an aid to generate unpredictability, but it is not a
person. You will have to be the one to interpret its responses.

## Taking Actions

Characters can undertake various actions and challenges.

1.  Some actions involve no risk or uncertainty and are simply resolved
    in the emerging narrative.
2.  Other actions (such as exploration) have uncertain outcomes and
    require querying the Oracle for the result.
3.  Actions that involve risk (like climbing steep walls or dodging a
    trap, and of course, combat) require making a Save on the relevant
    attribute.

## Ask the Oracle

When you need to determine the outcome of actions that aren't governed
by precise rules (as combat) or you need to figure out responses from
the game world or non-player characters (NPCs), you can:

1.  **Draw a Conclusion**: Decide the answer based on what's most
    interesting and obvious.
2.  **Ask a Yes/No Question**: Determine the likelihood of a "yes" and
    roll on the table below to check the answer.
3.  **Choose Between Two**: Imagine two options. Consider one as
    "likely" and roll on the table below to see if it's true. Otherwise,
    it's the other option.
4.  **Spark an Idea**: Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

## Oracle

1.  Roll a 1d100 to generate a number between 1 and 100.
2.  Check your roll on the table. The oracle will reveal its response.
3.  Consider the response in the context of your question and the
    current situation. Does it fit? Does it spark inspiration?
4.  If you have your answer, you're good to go\! Play to see what
    happens. If you want more details, you can roll for Sparks.
5.  If you're stuck, you can roll again, try another Spark, or simply
    rely on your intuition to decide what happens next.

| Probability       | No, and | No      | No, but | Yes, but | Yes     | Yes, and |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Almost Certain    | 1       | 2 - 4   | 5 - 10  | 11 - 25  | 26 - 75 | 76 - 100 |
| Very Likely       | 1 - 3   | 4 - 10  | 11 - 20 | 21 - 30  | 31 - 80 | 81 - 100 |
| Likely            | 1 - 7   | 8 - 17  | 18 - 32 | 33 - 44  | 45 - 85 | 86 - 100 |
| Unknown           | 1 - 10  | 11 - 40 | 41 - 50 | 51 - 60  | 61 - 90 | 91 - 100 |
| Unlikely          | 1 - 15  | 16 - 56 | 57 - 66 | 67 - 81  | 82 - 93 | 94 - 100 |
| Very Unlikely     | 1 - 20  | 21 - 70 | 71 - 80 | 81 - 90  | 91 - 97 | 98 - 100 |
| Almost Impossible | 1 - 25  | 26 - 75 | 76 - 90 | 91 - 96  | 97 - 99 | 100      |

## Complication

When the Oracle's response includes a "but," you can roll on the
following table to determine the complication that arises. Use it only
if you can't determine it from the context of the current scene:

| d10 | Complication               |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | Improves a minor condition |
| 2   | Worsens a minor condition  |
| 3   | Adds a minor condition     |
| 4   | Removes a minor condition  |
| 5   | Improves a major condition |
| 6   | Worsens a major condition  |
| 7   | Adds a major condition     |
| 8   | Removes a major condition  |
| 9   | Positive Spark             |
| 10  | Negative Spark             |

## Plot Twist

A double on your dice when rolling on the Oracle table triggers an
extreme result or a narrative twist.

| d100  | Event                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-5   | It was all a diversion.                                                                                       |
| 6-10  | An obscure secret is revealed.                                                                                |
| 11-15 | A trap is triggered.                                                                                          |
| 16-20 | An assumption proves false.                                                                                   |
| 21-25 | A secret alliance is unveiled.                                                                                |
| 26-30 | Your actions benefit an enemy.                                                                                |
| 31-35 | Someone returns unexpectedly.                                                                                 |
| 36-40 | A more dangerous enemy is revealed.                                                                           |
| 41-45 | You and an enemy share a common goal.                                                                         |
| 46-50 | A true identity is exposed.                                                                                   |
| 51-55 | You have been betrayed by someone you trusted.                                                                |
| 56-60 | You are too late.                                                                                             |
| 61-65 | The true enemy is revealed.                                                                                   |
| 66-70 | The enemy gains new allies.                                                                                   |
| 71-75 | A new threat emerges.                                                                                         |
| 76-80 | Someone or something disappears.                                                                              |
| 81-85 | The truth of a relationship is revealed.                                                                      |
| 86-90 | Two seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected.                                                 |
| 91-95 | Unexpected powers or abilities are revealed.                                                                  |
| 96-00 | Roll on this table two more times. Both results occur. If they are the same result, it becomes more dramatic. |

## Spark

Sparks can be invoked in the following cases:

1.  When you want to pose an open-ended question to the Oracle.
2.  When seeking inspiration.
3.  When invoked through a complication.

Sparks are used to inspire a discovery, an event, a character's goal, or
a situation. Combine rolls on both of the following tables (Action +
Theme) to provide an action and a subject. Then, interpret the result
based on the context of the question and your current situation.

# A simpler Star System Generator

The Star System Generator in the Core Rules can be expensive and
time-consuming.

A simpler generator is proposed here that is better suited to solitary
role-playing. **You don't necessarily have to pull on all the tables**.
Roll only those you find useful. If there are multiple planets in the
system, you don't need to roll all at once. Just determine one main
planet and start exploring that one\!

The star sector map represents the area in which the player is located.

The map is 8x10 hexes wide. Each hex represents the distance of 1
parsec.

## Stars

### Number of Stars (rolla a d10 per hex)

| d10 | Number of Stars                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1-5 | No stars                              |
| 6-9 | A moderate number of stars (roll 1d4) |
| 10  | Single star                           |

### Stellar Class (d6)

| d6  | Stellar Class    |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1-2 | Red Dwarf        |
| 3-4 | Main Sequence    |

## Stellar System

Once you have determined the number and class of stars in the star
sector, you can generate the details of a specific star system using the
following tables.

### Number of Planets (d6)

| 3-4 | A planet (roll a d4 to determine the type)                                                  |
| 5-6 | More than one planet (roll a d8 to determine the number and consult the planet types table) |

# Plerion - Solo Spacefarer

*I cautiously approach the derelict, anchoring my spaceship to the
deformed scaffolding with a slight, eerie creaking sound. As I cross the
threshold, I sense a feeling of unease, as if time itself has frozen in
this place.*

*The corridors are dark and dusty, illuminated only by faint red glows
from damaged control panels. Cables hang from the ceiling, and the sound
of my breathing is the only audible noise. I move cautiously, examining
every detail of the derelict. Every now and then, I hear a distant
whisper, a ghostly echo from a long-forgotten past.*

*As I traverse a narrow corridor, I feel an odd tremor coming from the
floor. I drop to my knees as the ground beneath me opens into a chasm. I
manage to stifle the sudden sensation of vertigo, reaching out and
grasping onto a protrusion. Slowly, I pull myself up and continue my
exploration with even greater care.*

*Further ahead, I reach a semi-destroyed control room. The screens
flicker intermittently, displaying distorted images and incomprehensible
codes. I manage to retrieve some encrypted files that might contain
valuable information about the ship's past, but deciphering them will be
a challenge.*

*Continuing my journey, I encounter mysterious creatures, blurry shadows
that seem to move in the corners. I'm unsure whether they are survivors
of the original crew or beings that appeared after the derelict was
abandoned. Regardless of their origin, I remain calm and ensure I avoid
their sinister gaze.*

*After hours of exploration, I reach the main cargo hold. The atmosphere
is thick with tension, as rays of sunlight filter through the cracks in
the ceiling. As I scrutinize the debris, I discover an intriguing
object: a mysterious luminescent sphere. I approach it cautiously,
extending my hand to touch it.*

*As my fingers brush against the sphere, an intense glow envelops me. I
suddenly feel as if I've been catapulted into another dimension. Visions
flash before me rapidly, fragments of past lives and unknown futures.*

*But when the glow fades, I find myself back in the cargo hold,
bewildered and perplexed. The luminescent sphere has vanished, leaving
behind only a sense of loss and an unsolved enigma. What did that vision
mean? What was the derelict hiding?*

*I don't have time to reflect further, as suddenly the derelict begins
to shake violently. Debris detaches from the walls and fills the
corridors, and the deafening sound startles me. With a frantic dash, I
run toward my spaceship, hoping to reach it before everything
collapses.*

# Intro

Welcome to *Solo Starfarer*. This booklet serves as a companion to
*Plerion*, the Space Opera Adventure Game based on Cairn. To make use of
these additional rules, **you'll require the Core Book**.

Here, you won't find information on character creation, combat, or
equipment.

Within these pages, you'll discover suggested approaches and procedures,
but consider them as flexible guidelines. All its components are modules
that you can "turn on or off" according to your taste. After all, this
is your game\! Do you wish to chart the vast reaches of interstellar
space? Use the Exploration Procedure and the Star System Generation
tables. Interested in scavenging a derelict vessel adrift in the cosmos?
Employ the Installations Generator and embark on your exploration. Fancy
venturing into speculative trading? Why not\!

The only limit is your imagination. Here, we offer you a structural
framework for those moments when inspiration may be lacking to kickstart
your adventure.

## What Is a Solo Role-Playing Game?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the
roles of imaginary characters and take actions and make decisions within
an imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is
often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as rolling
dice or using measurable character attributes.

In a solo role-playing game, a single player takes on the roles of one
or more characters while simultaneously managing certain elements of the
game world. These games typically involve the use of a rules system and
game mechanics to determine the outcomes of the actions taken by the
player-controlled characters.

Through the interaction between the player, oracle, tools, and prompts,
the character's actions will build an emerging narrative in which almost
anything can be attempted, with no predetermined limits.

If you are not familiar with Solo-RPGs, here are some excellent
introductory guides you can use to gain some insight:

  - *Solo Game Master's Guide* by Geek Gamers <https://t.ly/djXDK>
  - *Solo Roleplaying: A brief introduction* by Alex Yari
    <https://t.ly/oM_l6>
  - *Solo RPG Basics* <https://t.ly/f62eq>

If you want to try something simpler before embarking on a modular,
procedural game like this, Zotiquest Games published *Loner*, a very
light Solo-RPG written with beginners in mind. It's free\!

## Kickstart Your Adventure

If you've never played an RPG or even a solo RPG before, you might be
wondering what to do\! Here are some guidelines to kickstart your
adventure:

1.  **Create a Character:** Before beginning the game, create your
    character following the core rules.
2.  **Choose a Path:** will give you a role, additional resources and
    more background to immerse yourself in the game universe.
3.  **Starting Planet:** Start your adventure on a home planet, where
    you can stock up on supplies and items essential for your journey.
    The planet can be used as a starting point to explore the starry
    expanses. It doesn't need elaborate details; a simple outpost with a
    spaceport and a store will suffice. Perhaps a small colony with a
    bar.
4.  **Explore the Starry Expanse:** Start venturing among the stars in
    search of fortune\!
5.  **Combat:** If you encounter an enemy, prepare for battle. Use your
    statistics and skills to defeat the foe.
6.  **Solving Puzzles and Challenges:** During the game, you might come
    across puzzles and challenges that need to be solved. Use your
    cleverness and skills to overcome them and reap rewards.
7.  **Acquiring Items and Wealth:** Throughout your adventure, you may
    find useful items such as weapons, armor, and supplies. Collect
    anything that might be handy for your journey and keep track of your
    inventory.
8.  **Character Advancement:** As you progress in the game, your
    character will grow and evolve. This involves not only increasing
    your stats, but also acquiring new equipment, wealth and reputation.
9.  **Choices and Consequences:** Remember that your choices will
    influence the outcome of your adventure. Be mindful of what you
    choose and how you act, as it could have significant consequences
    for your journey.
10. **End of the Adventure:** You can play a single session or a
    campaign. You decide when to stop. From your actions and how the
    game world reacts, missions, unexpected goals, and relationships
    with Non-Player Characters will emerge. There are no predetermined
    limits: perhaps your character will rise to fame and glory or meet a
    gruesome end in a haunted derelict. Play to find out\!

# Game Procedures

The following procedures will help you give structure to your solitaire
game. You do not neet to follow them. Use them only if they are helpful
and adapt them where you feel it is necessary.

## Ground Procedures

Follow this procedure when a PC lands on a new planet. If you do not own
a ship skip the first step.

  - **Maintenance:** Pay ship costs and crew salaries. If needed, make
    repairs to the ship (if you can afford it).
  - **Take Action**: Each day you stay in a safe haven you can perform
    *one* of the following actions.
      - **Medical Care:** Treat injuries or pay for medical assistance.
      - **Look for a job:** if you need it, look for a job on the local
        spaceport assignment lists. Use the Job Generator to find out
        what's available.
      - **Listen to rumors:** you might listen to some rumors by
        eavesdropping among the docks or in the local bar. Use the rumor
        generator if you need it.
      - **Find a patron:** if you are particularly ambitious or needy,
        you will need to seek a patron for an actual Mission. You have a
        1-in-6 chance per week of crossing paths with such an offer.
      - **Buy/Sell goods or equipment:** if you are a Carrier devoted to
        speculative trading, now is a good time to do your magic.
  - **Roll for Event:**

| 2D6  | Event                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-6  | Unfavorable encounter or Disaster (Roll for Spark) |
| 7    | Nothing                                            |
| 8-12 | Favorable Encounter or Fortune (Roll for Spark)    |

**Note:** Remember that staying overnight and eating cost money\! The
more days you stay in a landing without doing anything or failing to get
work, the thinner your finances will shrink.

## Exploring Space

Exploring the cosmos can be highly rewarding but very risky. If you
undertake a path from Pathfinder, use the following procedure.

  - **Roll a Star System:** if you are entering an unkwon region of
    space, use the Star System Generation (in the core book) to
    determine the feature of the next system.
  - **Take Action:** now you can perform *one* of the following per
    turn.
      - **Travel:** you can travel everywhere in the reach granted by
        the fuel reserve of your ship.
      - **Explore:** if you entered a star system, you can explore its
        celestial body in search for interesting features or sources of
        income.
      - **Interact:** if the planet is inhabited, you can decide to
        interact with its population by radio or by landing.
      - **Dock:** you can dock on a planet equipped with a spaceport.
      - **Refuel:** if necessary and you have access to a spaceport you
        can refuel within your finances.
  - **Roll for Event:**

| 2D6   | Event                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Ship malfunction (deactivate one module) |
| 4-6   | Space Anomaly                            |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)             |
| 8-10  | Distress call                            |
| 11-12 | Advantage                                |

| 2D6   | Encounter (roll on reaction) |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Star Kraken                  |
| 4-6   | Pirates                      |
| 7     | Patrol                       |
| 8-10  | Freelancers                  |
| 11-12 | Star Leviathan               |

## Explore Installations

As Salvager you will find yourself exploring derelict ships and other
abandoned installations. Even in other paths you may find yourself
boarding and navigating installations that are still active. First use
the Installation Generator to determine Origin and Current Purpose. Then
follow the following procedure.

  - **Roll Area or Junction:** Use the relevant table to generate the
    current environment, its size, number of outputs and features.
  - **Roll for Event (see below):** check what happens, pulling on the
    event table-
  - **Take Action:** resolve the undertaken action.
      - If an encounter occurs use the reaction and possibly combat
        rules.
      - If you encounter a trap, use the Oracle and Saves to determine
        if you are affected.

| 2D6   | Event                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Exhaustion (need to rest)     |
| 4-6   | Trap                          |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)  |
| 8-10  | Clue regarding next encounter |
| 11-12 | Advantage                     |

## Build a Planetary Adventure

Sometimes you might want to get out of the spaceport and explore
planetary territory. In this case, the following procedure will help you
quickly define a map to navigate.

### Choose A Theme

1.  Pick a theme for the area. You can roll a *S* to get inspired.
2.  Come up with an adventure premise (you can roll a *Spark* or use the
    *Mission Generator*).
3.  Decide on a ruling faction, with traits & motive (roll on the *NPC
    and Faction Generator*).
4.  Add some kind of counter balance (another faction, some kind of
    nefarious enemy, etc).

### Draw A Planetary Map

1.  Take a sheet of paper or a virtual canvas.
2.  Draw at least four lines of any shape, each from a different color.
    Each line should cross another at least once. These lines represent
    roads or paths.
3.  Generate at least 3 Points of Interest: take in consideration the
    theme(s) and factions. Put these wherever the lines cross.
4.  Generate regional features for each POI using tables and placing
    results in those POIs where it makes most sense.
5.  Place additional (especially hidden) dangers, encounters or NPC’s in
    some of the POI.
6.  Add some travel/route complications, taking in consideration any
    POIs along the way.

### Create Encounters

1.  Make an encounter table (either 1d6 or 2d6), with at least one
    result tied to the party or its members.
2.  Details on any Artifact (Who wants it? Where is it now? Why wasn’t
    it ransacked before?). Include maps.
3.  Roll area/junction for an installation.

You do not need to do this for ever single POI, only those that interest
you.

# Tuning Characters and Combat for Solo play

Plerion's core rules are designed for a group of characters facing
dangers together. By venturing as loners into interstellar space, the
risks increase and death is a much bleaker omen.

To make your character more durable, without betraying the Old School
style of this game, here are a couple of viable options:

1.  **Enhanced Character** (for lone spacers only):
    1.  When you generate the character, he is automatically assigned 6
        HP, without the need to pull it.
    2.  When damage is rolled, a d4 "Enhanced Die" is added.
    3.  When a Save is rolled instead, the Enhanced Die is subtracted
        from the total.
    4.  When the character wants to escape, make a DEX Save. On a
        success, the PC manages to escape from combat.
2.  **Use assistants**:
    1.  *Instead of the Enhanced Character* option, automatically assign
        one or two companions (following the creation rules in the core
        book).
    2.  Assistants have a background (drawn randomly on the relevant
        table) that will be able to guarantee any situational
        advantages.
    3.  This type of assistant has a monthly salary of 1,000 credits
        each. Take this into account in your finances.
    4.  Assistants have no funds or inventory management (assume they
        have a weapon and items needed for the current mission). You can
        equip them with a more powerful weapon if you have purchased it
        and are not using it.
    5.  When you ask them to do something risky or potentially lethal,
        they perform a WIL Save. If they fail, they will refuse to
        comply and potentially could quit.

# Resolve Uncertainty

In a solo game you will have to manage your character and the game world
at the same time. But you're not writing a novel\! Subverting your
expectations and being surprised by the unpredictability of the shots is
an integral part of this style of play. Here you will find an Oracle and
other tools to help you introduce and manage the uncertainty of actions.
The Oracle is an aid to generate unpredictability, but it is not a
person. You will have to be the one to interpret its responses.

## Taking Actions

Characters can undertake various actions and challenges.

1.  Some actions involve no risk or uncertainty and are simply resolved
    in the emerging narrative.
2.  Other actions (such as exploration) have uncertain outcomes and
    require querying the Oracle for the result.
3.  Actions that involve risk (like climbing steep walls or dodging a
    trap, and of course, combat) require making a Save on the relevant
    attribute.

## Ask the Oracle

When you need to determine the outcome of actions that aren't governed
by precise rules (as combat) or you need to figure out responses from
the game world or non-player characters (NPCs), you can:

1.  **Draw a Conclusion**: Decide the answer based on what's most
    interesting and obvious.
2.  **Ask a Yes/No Question**: Determine the likelihood of a "yes" and
    roll on the table below to check the answer.
3.  **Choose Between Two**: Imagine two options. Consider one as
    "likely" and roll on the table below to see if it's true. Otherwise,
    it's the other option.
4.  **Spark an Idea**: Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

## Oracle

1.  Roll a 1d100 to generate a number between 1 and 100.
2.  Check your roll on the table. The oracle will reveal its response.
3.  Consider the response in the context of your question and the
    current situation. Does it fit? Does it spark inspiration?
4.  If you have your answer, you're good to go\! Play to see what
    happens. If you want more details, you can roll for Omens.
5.  If you're stuck, you can roll again, try another Spark, or simply
    rely on your intuition to decide what happens next.

| Probability       | No, and | No      | No, but | Yes, but | Yes     | Yes, and |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Almost Certain    | 1       | 2 - 4   | 5 - 10  | 11 - 25  | 26 - 75 | 76 - 100 |
| Very Likely       | 1 - 3   | 4 - 10  | 11 - 20 | 21 - 30  | 31 - 80 | 81 - 100 |
| Likely            | 1 - 7   | 8 - 17  | 18 - 32 | 33 - 44  | 45 - 85 | 86 - 100 |
| Unknown           | 1 - 10  | 11 - 40 | 41 - 50 | 51 - 60  | 61 - 90 | 91 - 100 |
| Unlikely          | 1 - 15  | 16 - 56 | 57 - 66 | 67 - 81  | 82 - 93 | 94 - 100 |
| Very Unlikely     | 1 - 20  | 21 - 70 | 71 - 80 | 81 - 90  | 91 - 97 | 98 - 100 |
| Almost Impossible | 1 - 25  | 26 - 75 | 76 - 90 | 91 - 96  | 97 - 99 | 100      |

## Complication

When the Oracle's response includes a "but," you can roll on the
following table to determine the complication that arises. Use it only
if you can't determine it from the context of the current scene:

| d10 | Complication               |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | Improves a minor condition |
| 2   | Worsens a minor condition  |
| 3   | Adds a minor condition     |
| 4   | Removes a minor condition  |
| 5   | Improves a major condition |
| 6   | Worsens a major condition  |
| 7   | Adds a major condition     |
| 8   | Removes a major condition  |
| 9   | Positive Spark             |
| 10  | Negative Spark             |

## Plot Twist

A double on your dice when rolling on the Oracle table triggers an
extreme result or a narrative twist.

| d100  | Event                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-5   | It was all a diversion.                                                                                       |
| 6-10  | An obscure secret is revealed.                                                                                |
| 11-15 | A trap is triggered.                                                                                          |
| 16-20 | An assumption proves false.                                                                                   |
| 21-25 | A secret alliance is unveiled.                                                                                |
| 26-30 | Your actions benefit an enemy.                                                                                |
| 31-35 | Someone returns unexpectedly.                                                                                 |
| 36-40 | A more dangerous enemy is revealed.                                                                           |
| 41-45 | You and an enemy share a common goal.                                                                         |
| 46-50 | A true identity is exposed.                                                                                   |
| 51-55 | You have been betrayed by someone you trusted.                                                                |
| 56-60 | You are too late.                                                                                             |
| 61-65 | The true enemy is revealed.                                                                                   |
| 66-70 | The enemy gains new allies.                                                                                   |
| 71-75 | A new threat emerges.                                                                                         |
| 76-80 | Someone or something disappears.                                                                              |
| 81-85 | The truth of a relationship is revealed.                                                                      |
| 86-90 | Two seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected.                                                 |
| 91-95 | Unexpected powers or abilities are revealed.                                                                  |
| 96-00 | Roll on this table two more times. Both results occur. If they are the same result, it becomes more dramatic. |

## Spark

Omens can be invoked in the following cases:

1.  When you want to pose an open-ended question to the Oracle.
2.  When seeking inspiration.
3.  When invoked through a complication.

Omens are used to inspire a discovery, an event, a character's goal, or
a situation. Combine rolls on both of the following tables (Action +
Theme) to provide an action and a subject. Then, interpret the result
based on the context of the question and your current situation.

# A simpler Star System Generator

The Star System Generator in the Core Rules can be expensive and
time-consuming.

A simpler generator is proposed here that is better suited to solitary
role-playing. **You don't necessarily have to pull on all the tables**.
Roll only those you find useful. If there are multiple planets in the
system, you don't need to roll all at once. Just determine one main
planet and start exploring that one\!

The star sector map represents the area in which the player is located.

The map is 8x10 hexes wide. Each hex represents the distance of 1
parsec.

## Stars

### Number of Stars (rolla a d10 per hex)

| d10 | Number of Stars                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1-5 | No stars                              |
| 6-9 | A moderate number of stars (roll 1d4) |
| 10  | Single star                           |

### Stellar Class (d6)

| d6  | Stellar Class    |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1-2 | Red Dwarf        |
| 3-4 | Main Sequence    |
| 5-6 | Giant/Supergiant |

## Stella System

Once you have determined the number and class of stars in the star
sector, you can generate the details of a specific star system using the
following tables.

### Number of Planets (d6)

| d6  | Presence of Planets                                                                         |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | No Planet                                                                                   |
| 3-4 | A planet (roll a d4 to determine the type)                                                  |
| 5-6 | More than one planet (roll a d8 to determine the number and consult the planet types table) |

### Extra Features of the System (d6)

| d6 | Extra Features              |
| -- | --------------------------- |
| 1  | Wormhole Gate               |
| 2  | Asteroid Field              |
| 3  | Wrecked Alien Megastructure |
| 4  | Spatial anomaly             |
| 5  | Black hole                  |
| 6  | Unknown Energy Flow         |

## Planets

### Planet Type

| d100   | Type of Planet                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1-5    | Rocky                           |
