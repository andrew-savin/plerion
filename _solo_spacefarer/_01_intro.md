# Intro
This booklet serves as a companion to "Loner," the Space Opera Adventure Game based on Cairn. To make use of these additional rules, you'll require the core book. Here, you won't find information on character creation, combat, or equipment.

Within these pages, you'll discover suggested approaches and procedures, but consider them as flexible guidelines. After all, this is your game, and you can adjust it to your liking. Do you wish to chart the vast reaches of interstellar space? Utilize the exploration procedure and the star system generation tables from the core book. Interested in scavenging a derelict vessel adrift in the cosmos? Employ the installation generation system and embark on your exploration. Fancy venturing into speculative trading? Why not!

The only limit is your imagination. Here, we offer you a structural framework for those moments when inspiration may be lacking to kickstart your adventure.

## What Is a Solo Role-Playing Game?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of imaginary characters and take actions and make decisions within an imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as rolling dice or using measurable character attributes.

In a solo role-playing game, a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters while simultaneously managing certain elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rules system and game mechanics to determine the outcomes of the actions taken by the player-controlled characters.

Through the interaction between the player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an emerging narrative in which almost anything can be attempted, with no predetermined limits.

## Kickstart

In this game, you are the protagonist of your adventure, where your wit, strength, and luck will help you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. 

Your character embarks on their adventure on a planet surrounded by unexplored starry expanses generated at random. Follow the story that unfolds from your actions, but don't forget to be creative and make choices along the way. Your gaming experience depends on how you choose to tackle these challenges.

If you've never played an RPG or even a solo RPG before, you might be wondering what to do once your character is generated! Here are some guidelines to kickstart your adventure:

1. **Create a Character:** Before beginning the game, create your character following the core rules.
2. **Choose a Path:** will give you a role, additional resources and more background to immerse yourself in the game universe.
3. **Starting Planet:** Start your adventure on a home planet, where you can stock up on supplies and items essential for your journey. The planet can be used as a starting point to explore the starry expanses. It doesn't need elaborate details; a simple outpost with a spaceport and a store will suffice. Perhaps a small colony with a bar.
4. **Explore the Starry Expanse:** Start venturing among the stars in search of fortune!
5. **Combat:** If you encounter an enemy, prepare for battle. Use your statistics and skills to defeat the foe.
6. **Solving Puzzles and Challenges:** During the game, you might come across puzzles and challenges that need to be solved. Use your cleverness and skills to overcome them and reap rewards.
7. **Acquiring Items and Wealth:** Throughout your adventure, you may find useful items such as weapons, armor, and supplies. Collect anything that might be handy for your journey and keep track of your inventory.
8. **Character Advancement:** As you progress in the game, your character will grow and evolve. This involves not only increasing your stats, but also acquiring new equipment, wealth and reputation.
9. **Choices and Consequences:** Remember that your choices will influence the outcome of your adventure. Be mindful of what you choose and how you act, as it could have significant consequences for your journey.
10. **End of the Adventure:** You can play a single session or a campaign. You decide when to stop. From your actions and how the game world reacts, missions, unexpected goals, and relationships with Non-Player Characters will emerge. There are no predetermined limits: perhaps your character will rise to fame and glory or meet a gruesome end in a haunted derelict. Play to find out!
