# Game Procedures

The following procedures will help you give structure to your solitaire game. You are not necessarily obliged to follow them; use them only if they are helpful and adapt them where you feel it is necessary.

## Ground Procedures

Follow this procedure when a PC lands on a new planet. If you do not own a ship skip the first step.

- **Maintenance:** Pay ship costs and crew salaries. If needed, make repairs to the ship (if you can afford it).
- **Take Action**: Each day you stay in a safe haven you can perform _one_ of the following actions.
  - **Medical Care:** Treat injuries or pay for medical assistance.
  - **Look for a job:** if you need it, look for a job on the local spaceport assignment lists. Use the Job Generator to find out what's available.
  - **Listen to rumors:** you might listen to some rumors by eavesdropping among the docks or in the local bar. Use the rumor generator if you need it.
  - **Find a patron:** if you are particularly ambitious or needy, you will need to seek a patron for an actual Mission. You have a 1-in-6 chance per week of crossing paths with such an offer.
  - **Buy/Sell goods or equipment:** if you are a Carrier devoted to speculative trading, now is a good time to do your magic.
- **Roll for Event:** 

| 2D6  | Event                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-6  | Unfavorable encounter or Disaster (Roll for Omen) |
| 7    | Nothing                                           |
| 8-12 | Favorable Encounter or Fortune (Roll for Omen)    |

**Note:** Remember that staying overnight and eating cost money! The more days you stay in a landing without doing anything or failing to get work, the thinner your finances will shrink. 

## Exploring Space

Exploring the cosmos can be highly rewarding but very risky. If you undertake a path from Pathfinder, use the following procedure.

- **Roll a Star System:** if you are entering an unkwon region of space, use the Star System Generation (in the core book) to determine the feature of the next system.
- **Take Action:** now you can perform _one_ of the following per turn.
  - **Travel:** you can travel everywhere in the reach granted by the fuel reserve of your ship.
  - **Explore:** if you entered a star system, you can explore its celestial body in search for interesting features or sources of income.
  - **Interact:** if the planet is inhabited, you can decide to interact with its population by radio or by landing.
  - **Dock:** you can dock on a planet equipped with a spaceport.
  - **Refuel:** if necessary and you have access to a spaceport you can refuel within your finances.
- **Roll for Event:** 

| 2D6   | Event                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Ship malfunction (deactivate one module) |
| 4-6   | Space Anomaly                            |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)             |
| 8-10  | Distress call                            |
| 11-12 | Advantage                                |


| 2D6   | Encounter (roll on reaction) |

| 7     | Patrol                       |
| 8-10  | Freelancers                  |
| 11-12 | Star Leviathan               |

## Explore Installations

As Salvager you will find yourself exploring derelict ships and other abandoned installations. Even in other paths you may find yourself boarding and navigating installations that are still active. First use the Installation Generator to determine Origin and Current Purpose. Then follow the following procedure.

- **Roll Area or Junction:** Use the relevant table to generate the current environment, its size, number of outputs and features.
- **Roll for Event (see below):** check what happens, pulling on the event table-
- **Take Action:** resolve the undertaken action. 
  - If an encounter occurs use the reaction and possibly combat rules. 
  - If you encounter a trap, use the Oracle and Saves to determine if you are affected.

| 2D6   | Event                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Exhaustion (need to rest)     |
| 4-6   | Trap                          |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)  |
