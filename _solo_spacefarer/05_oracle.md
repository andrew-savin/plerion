# Resolve Uncertainty

In a solo game you will have to manage your character and the game world at the same time. But you're not writing a novel! Subverting your expectations and being surprised by the unpredictability of the shots is an integral part of this style of play. Here you will find an Oracle and other tools to help you introduce and manage the uncertainty of actions. The Oracle is an aid to generate unpredictability, but it is not a person. You will have to be the one to interpret its responses.

## Taking Actions
Characters can undertake various actions and challenges. 
1. Some actions involve no risk or uncertainty and are simply resolved in the emerging narrative. 
2. Other actions (such as exploration) have uncertain outcomes and require querying the Oracle for the result. 
3. Actions that involve risk (like climbing steep walls or dodging a trap, and of course, combat) require making a Save on the relevant attribute.

## Ask the Oracle

When you need to determine the outcome of actions that aren't governed by precise rules (as combat) or you need to figure out responses from the game world or non-player characters (NPCs), you can:

1. **Draw a Conclusion**: Decide the answer based on what's most interesting and obvious.
2. **Ask a Yes/No Question**: Determine the likelihood of a "yes" and roll on the table below to check the answer.
3. **Choose Between Two**: Imagine two options. Consider one as "likely" and roll on the table below to see if it's true. Otherwise, it's the other option.
4. **Spark an Idea**: Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

## Oracle

1. Roll a 1d100 to generate a number between 1 and 100.
2. Check your roll on the table. The oracle will reveal its response.
3. Consider the response in the context of your question and the current situation. Does it fit? Does it spark inspiration?
4. If you have your answer, you're good to go! Play to see what happens. If you want more details, you can roll for Omens.
5. If you're stuck, you can roll again, try another Omen, or simply rely on your intuition to decide what happens next.

| Probability         | No, and  | No      | No, but  | Yes, but  | Yes      | Yes, and  |
|---------------------|----------|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Almost Certain      | 1        | 2 - 4   | 5 - 10   | 11 - 25  | 26 - 75  | 76 - 100  |
| Very Likely         | 1 - 3    | 4 - 10  | 11 - 20  | 21 - 30  | 31 - 80  | 81 - 100  |
| Likely              | 1 - 7    | 8 - 17  | 18 - 32  | 33 - 44  | 45 - 85  | 86 - 100  |
| Unknown             | 1 - 10   | 11 - 40 | 41 - 50  | 51 - 60  | 61 - 90  | 91 - 100  |

| Almost Impossible   | 1 - 25   | 26 - 75 | 76 - 90  | 91 - 96  | 97 - 99  | 100       |

## Complication

When the Oracle's response includes a "but," you can roll on the following table to determine the complication that arises. Use it only if you can't determine it from the context of the current scene:

| d10 | Complication                    |
|-----|----------------------------------|
| 1   | Improves a minor condition       |
| 2   | Worsens a minor condition        |
| 3   | Adds a minor condition           |
| 4   | Removes a minor condition        |
| 5   | Improves a major condition       |
| 6   | Worsens a major condition        |
| 7   | Adds a major condition           |
| 8   | Removes a major condition        |
| 9   | Positive Omen                    |
| 10  | Negative Omen                    |

## Plot Twist

A double on your dice when rolling on the Oracle table triggers an extreme result or a narrative twist.

| d100  | Event                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-5   | It was all a diversion.                                                                                       |
| 6-10  | An obscure secret is revealed.                                                                                |
| 11-15 | A trap is triggered.                                                                                          |
| 16-20 | An assumption proves false.                                                                                   |
| 21-25 | A secret alliance is unveiled.                                                                                |
| 26-30 | Your actions benefit an enemy.                                                                                |
| 31-35 | Someone returns unexpectedly.                                                                                 |
| 36-40 | A more dangerous enemy is revealed.                                                                           |
| 41-45 | You and an enemy share a common goal.                                                                         |
| 46-50 | A true identity is exposed.                                                                                   |
| 51-55 | You have been betrayed by someone you trusted.                                                                |
| 56-60 | You are too late.                                                                                             |
| 61-65 | The true enemy is revealed.                                                                                   |
| 66-70 | The enemy gains new allies.                                                                                   |
| 71-75 | A new threat emerges.                                                                                         |
| 76-80 | Someone or something disappears.                                                                              |
| 81-85 | The truth of a relationship is revealed.                                                                      |
| 86-90 | Two seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected.                                                 |
| 91-95 | Unexpected powers or abilities are revealed.                                                                  |
| 96-00 | Roll on this table two more times. Both results occur. If they are the same result, it becomes more dramatic. |

## Omen

Omens can be invoked in the following cases:

1. When you want to pose an open-ended question to the Oracle.
2. When seeking inspiration.
3. When invoked through a complication.

Omens are used to inspire a discovery, an event, a character's goal, or a situation. Combine rolls on both of the following tables (Action + Theme) to provide an action and a subject. Then, interpret the result based on the context of the question and your current situation.
