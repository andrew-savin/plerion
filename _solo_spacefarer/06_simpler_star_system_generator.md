# A simpler Star System Generator

The Star System Generator in the Core Rules can be expensive and time-consuming. 

A simpler generator is proposed here that is better suited to solitary role-playing. **You don't necessarily have to pull on all the tables**. Roll only those you find useful. If there are multiple planets in the system, you don't need to roll all at once. Just determine one main planet and start exploring that one!

The star sector map represents the area in which the player is located. 

The map is 8x10 hexes wide. Each hex represents the distance of 1 parsec.

## Stars

### Number of Stars (rolla a d10 per hex)

| d10  | Number of Stars                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1-5 | No stars                              |
| 6-9 | A moderate number of stars (roll 1d4) |
| 10  | Single star                           |

### Stellar Class (d6)

| d6     | Stellar Class               |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 1-2 | Red Dwarf                    |

| 5-6 | Giant/Supergiant       |

## Stella System

Once you have determined the number and class of stars in the star sector, you can generate the details of a specific star system using the following tables.

### Number of Planets (d6)

| d6  | Presence of Planets                                                                             |

| 3-4 | A planet (roll a d4 to determine the type)                                                      |
| 5-6 | More than one planet (roll a d8 to determine the number and consult the planet types table) |
