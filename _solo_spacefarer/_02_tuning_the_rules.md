# Tuning Characters and Combat for Solo play

Plerion's core rules are designed for a group of characters facing dangers together. 
By venturing as loners into interstellar space, the risks increase and death is a much bleaker omen.

To make your character more durable, without betraying the Old School style of this game, here are a couple of viable options:
1) **Enhanced Character** (for lone spacers only):
   1) When you generate the character, he is automatically assigned 6 HP, without the need to pull it. 
   2) When damage is rolled, a d4 "Enhanced Die" is added. 
   3) When a Save is rolled instead, the Enhanced Die is subtracted from the total.
   4) When the character wants to escape, make a DEX Save. On a success, the PC manages to escape from combat.
2) **Use assistants**: 
   1) _Instead of the Enhanced Character_ option, automatically assign one or two companions (following the creation rules in the core book).
   2) Assistants have a background (drawn randomly on the relevant table) that will be able to guarantee any situational advantages.
   3) This type of assistant has a monthly salary of 1,000 credits each. Take this into account in your finances.
   4) Assistants have no funds or inventory management (assume they have a weapon and items needed for the current mission). You can equip them with a more powerful weapon if you have purchased it and are not using it.
   4) When you ask them to do something risky or potentially lethal, they perform a WIL Save. If they fail, they will refuse to comply and potentially could quit.
