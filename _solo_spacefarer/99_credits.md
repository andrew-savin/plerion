- The tables in the NPCs and Factions Generators section is taken from _Any Planet is Earth_ CC BY Jim Parkin.
- Some texts and the Complication and Plot Twist tables in the Resolve Uncertainty section are taken from Ironsworn, created by Shawn Tomkin, and licensed for our use under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- The ideas in the _Tuning Characters_ section have been circulating in the RPG community for quite some time now. The Enhanced Dice idea comes from the Fray Dice in Scarlet Heroes by Kevin Crawford, although here I use a modified version proposed by Perplexing Ruins and Chaocalypse. The idea of maximizing HP to 6 is from Emerance.
- _Build a Planetary Adventure_ section is adapted from Cairn's website (CC BY-SA Yochai Gal).
