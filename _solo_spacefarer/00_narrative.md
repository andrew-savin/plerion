# Plerion - Solo Starfarer

_I cautiously approach the derelict, anchoring my spaceship to the deformed scaffolding with a slight, eerie creaking sound. As I cross the threshold, I sense a feeling of unease, as if time itself has frozen in this place._

_The corridors are dark and dusty, illuminated only by faint red glows from damaged control panels. Cables hang from the ceiling, and the sound of my breathing is the only audible noise. I move cautiously, examining every detail of the derelict. Every now and then, I hear a distant whisper, a ghostly echo from a long-forgotten past._

_As I traverse a narrow corridor, I feel an odd tremor coming from the floor. I drop to my knees as the ground beneath me opens into a chasm. I manage to stifle the sudden sensation of vertigo, reaching out and grasping onto a protrusion. Slowly, I pull myself up and continue my exploration with even greater care._

_Further ahead, I reach a semi-destroyed control room. The screens flicker intermittently, displaying distorted images and incomprehensible codes. I manage to retrieve some encrypted files that might contain valuable information about the ship's past, but deciphering them will be a challenge._

_Continuing my journey, I encounter mysterious creatures, blurry shadows that seem to move in the corners. I'm unsure whether they are survivors of the original crew or beings that appeared after the derelict was abandoned. Regardless of their origin, I remain calm and ensure I avoid their sinister gaze._

_After hours of exploration, I reach the main cargo hold. The atmosphere is thick with tension, as rays of sunlight filter through the cracks in the ceiling. As I scrutinize the debris, I discover an intriguing object: a mysterious luminescent sphere. I approach it cautiously, extending my hand to touch it._

_As my fingers brush against the sphere, an intense glow envelops me. I suddenly feel as if I've been catapulted into another dimension. Visions flash before me rapidly, fragments of past lives and unknown futures._

_But when the glow fades, I find myself back in the cargo hold, bewildered and perplexed. The luminescent sphere has vanished, leaving behind only a sense of loss and an unsolved enigma. What did that vision mean? What was the derelict hiding?_

_I don't have time to reflect further, as suddenly the derelict begins to shake violently. Debris detaches from the walls and fills the corridors, and the deafening sound startles me. With a frantic dash, I run toward my spaceship, hoping to reach it before everything collapses._
