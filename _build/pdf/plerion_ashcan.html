<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Plerion</strong> was written with the following design philosophies in mind:</p>
<h2 id="neutrality">Neutrality</h2>
<p>The referee's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.</p>
<h2 id="classless">Classless</h2>
<p>A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.</p>
<h2 id="fiction-first">Fiction First</h2>
<p>Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the referee in dialogue with the players, based on in-universe elements.</p>
<h2 id="growth">Growth</h2>
<p>Characters are changed through in-universe advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.</p>
<h2 id="player-choice">Player Choice</h2>
<p>Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<p>The referee and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.</p>
<h2 id="shared-objectives">Shared Objectives</h2>
<p>Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.</p>
<p><a href="#index">back to index</a></p>
<h1 id="principles-for-referees">Principles for referees</h1>
<h2 id="information">Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide useful information about the game universe as the characters explore it.</li>
<li>Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.</li>
<li>Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.</li>
<li>Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>
<ul>
<li>Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.</li>
<li>If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.</li>
<li>Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.</li>
<li>Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game universe is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.</li>
<li>Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.</li>
<li>NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the universe.</li>
<li>NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="narrative-focus">Narrative Focus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players,then put realistic opportunities in their path.</li>
<li>A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="danger">Danger</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game universe produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.</li>
<li>Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.</li>
<li>Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.</li>
<li>Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the universe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reward">Reward</h2>
<ul>
<li>A reward is specific to the mission for is granted. It tells a story.</li>
<li>Reward is highly valuable and is worth wealth and prestige.</li>
<li>Artifacts are not Rewards, though they are useful and interesting.</li>
<li>Use Reward as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choice">Choice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.</li>
<li>Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.</li>
<li>Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.</li>
<li>Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game universe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="die-of-fate">Die of Fate</h2>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge,etc.).</li>
<li>In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.</li>
<li>A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#index">back to index</a></p>
<h1 id="principles-for-players">Principles for Players</h1>
<h2 id="agency">Agency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.</li>
<li>Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.</li>
<li>Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.</li>
<li>Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.</li>
<li>Take the referee's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.</li>
<li>There is no single correct way forward.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="talking">Talking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.</li>
<li>You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="caution">Caution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.</li>
<li>Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.</li>
<li>Do some research and ask around about your objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ambition">Ambition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.</li>
<li>Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.</li>
<li>Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#index">back to index</a></p>
<h1 id="principles-of-the-universe">Principles of the Universe</h1>
<h2 id="space-is-vast--dangerous">Space is vast &amp; dangerous</h2>
<ul>
<li>The sidereal space is vast, impossible to cross without the appropriate means.</li>
<li>Out there you are almost always alone, in case of trouble nobody is likely to help you.</li>
<li>Alien creatures, pathogens and unfamiliar technology are the order of the day in uncharted regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="charted-space-is-not-so-well-known">Charted Space is not so well-known</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are five galaxies in the Charted Space.</li>
<li>There are billions of unknown system in there ready to be explored (and exploited).</li>
<li>Mapping space is profitable: governments and organizations are willing to pay well for data on new targets and territories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fast-travel-is-possible">Fast travel is possible</h2>
<ul>
<li>The discovery of <em>oddspace</em> opened the door to interstellar travel, at 1 parsec/hour.</li>
<li>Natural and artificial wormholes are used to reduce the time between <em>clusters</em>.</li>
<li>The Charted Space is dotted with military, commercial and industrial stations that form the nodes of the travel network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="humans-are-not-alone">Humans are not alone</h2>
<ul>
<li>Humans are not the only species out there nor the most prominent one.</li>
<li>Extinct species have left deep traces, such as artifacts and lost technology, usually found in ruins.</li>
<li>Some species are as old as galaxies and still active and present.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="great-empires-exist">Great empires exist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Empires (federations, commonwealths, etc.) are vast multi-species entities covering large portions of the galaxies.</li>
<li>Their influence is great especially on small independent nations.</li>
<li>Territorial claims are often disputed and cause conflict. Frontiers are risky but profitable places.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technology-level-is-variable">Technology level is variable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Technology is not all at the same level in Charted Space</li>
<li>It varies by country/species, but also from core to fringe of each one.</li>
<li>Exporting advanced technology is profitable but can cause severe problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interspecies-relationships-are-complex">Interspecies relationships are complex</h2>
<ul>
<li>The species of known space are amalgamated in a precarious multiculturalism that generates both growth and conflict.</li>
<li>Cosmopolitanism is a dominant trait of empires, distrust or xenophobia of smaller nations.</li>
<li>Spacers are usually open and welcoming and have no problem working with people of other species.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="profits-are-risky">Profits are risky</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spacers have different ways of making profit, but all of them are risky.</li>
<li>Paramilitary and mercenary missions are a great source of income.</li>
<li>Interstellar trade, search for artifacts, or exploration missions are another common activity of spacers.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#index">back to index</a></p>
<h1 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h1>
<h2 id="name-background--traits">Name, Background &amp; Traits</h2>
<p>First, choose or roll your PC’s <strong>name</strong> and <strong>background</strong> from their respective <a href="#name--d20">tables</a>. A PC’s background informs their potential knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Next, roll for the rest of your character's <strong>traits</strong> (appearance, speech, mannerisms, beliefs, reputation, etc.) on the <a href="#origins--traits--d20"><strong>Character Traits</strong></a> tables.</p>
<p>Finally, roll for their <strong>age</strong> (2d20+10).</p>
<h2 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h2>
<p>Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:<br />
<strong>Strength (STR)</strong>, <strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong>, and <strong>Willpower (WIL)</strong>. When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br />
Aniet rolls for her character's <strong>STR</strong>, resulting in a <strong>2</strong>, a <strong>4</strong>, and a <strong>6</strong>, totaling <strong>12</strong>. The next two ability rolls result in a <strong>9</strong> for <strong>DEX</strong> and a <strong>13</strong> for <strong>WIL</strong>. She decides to swap the <strong>12</strong> and the <strong>9</strong>, for a character with <strong>9 STR</strong>, <strong>12 DEX</strong> and <strong>13</strong> <strong>WIL</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hit-protection">Hit Protection</h2>
<p>Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting <strong>Hit Protection</strong> (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see <strong>Healing</strong>). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the <a href="#scars-table"><strong>Scars</strong></a> table.</p>
<h2 id="inventory">Inventory</h2>
<p>Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.</p>
<p>Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the referee's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Bulky</strong> items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.</p>
<p>A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Vehicles and backpacks can increase inventory. <strong>Assistants</strong> can also be paid to carry equipment.</p>
<h2 id="starting-gear">Starting Gear</h2>
<p>All PCs begin with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days' rations (one slot)</li>
<li>A personal comms (one slot)</li>
<li>3d6 credits</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll once on each of the <strong>Starting Gear</strong> tables to determine your PC's armor, weapons, tools, vehicles and equipment.</p>
<p>It is best to provide the party with a spaceship, roll once on the relevant table to determine which vessel is assigned.</p>
<p>See the <strong>Equipment List</strong> for related armor, damage, and slot values. Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.</p>
<p>If you would like something closer to traditional classes, refer to the list of <a href="#optional-gear-packages"><strong>Optional Gear Packages</strong></a>.</p>

<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
<p>Each of the three <strong>abilities</strong> are used in different circumstances (see <strong>saves</strong>, below).</p>
<p><strong>Strength (STR)</strong>: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong>: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Willpower (WIL)</strong>: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, psionics, etc.</p>
<h2 id="saves">Saves</h2>
<p>A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br />
<em>Aniet encounters a group of heavily-armed Combat Robots standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="healing">Healing</h2>
<p>Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss (see <strong>Critical Damage</strong>) can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.</p>
<h2 id="deprivation--fatigue">Deprivation &amp; Fatigue</h2>
<p>A PC <strong>deprived</strong> of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds <strong>Fatigue</strong> to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).</p>
<h2 id="armor-2">Armor</h2>
<p>Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's <strong>Armor</strong> value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.<br />
No one can have more than 3 Armor.<br />
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according to their use.</p>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<p>When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the referee may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">2</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">3-5</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">6-8</th>

<td style="text-align: center;">Helpful</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="morale">Morale</h2>
<p>Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.</p>
<h2 id="assistants">Assistants</h2>
<p>PCs can hire <strong>Assistants</strong> to aid them in their expeditions. To create an Assistant, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the <a href="#character-creation"><strong>Character Creation</strong></a> tables to further flesh them out. Assistants cost between 1-3sc per day, or a share of whatever Reward the party obtains.</p>
<h2 id="wealth--reward">Wealth &amp; Reward</h2>
<p>Everything costs credits, everyone gets paid in credits. One credits is equivalent to a one copper piece in <strong>Cairn</strong>.</p>
<p>The Reward is what pushes the spacers to adventure, often out of necessity (pay the expenses, make a living), other times for prestige or mere sake of adventure. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, by confronting them with intimidating foes.</p>
<p>Planets, space installations, and starports barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.</p>
<p><a href="#index">back to index</a></p>
<h1 id="cybernetics">Cybernetics</h1>
<p>Body parts can be replaced or grafted with advanced technological products that increase their power and capabilities. Beings augmented in this way receive the benefits, but are also subject to deterioration and hacking, as well as potential overloads and sensitivity to magnetic fields. In these cases, a saving throw against STR must be passed to avoid <strong>Critical Damage</strong>.</p>
<p>Augmentations have a cost of purchase and installation, as well as periodic maintenance (see Equipment). Installation has a recovery time of 1d6 days within which absolute rest is required. Missing revisions results in malfunctioning implants, forcing a saving throw every 1d6 days until maintenance or removal.</p>
<h2 id="implants">Implants</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Air Filter</strong>: It provides immunity to toxic or non-breathable atmospheres.</li>
<li><strong>Augmented Reflexes</strong>: Nerve implants that improve above average reflexes of the subject. Permanent +2 DEX until removal, wear or malfunction.</li>

</ol>
<p><a href="#index">back to index</a></p>
<h1 id="psionics">Psionics</h1>
<p>Psionics is the art of using the mind over matter and spirit. It is a latent ability in all sentient beings, but not everyone can use it. Usually the subject demonstrates the psionic ability in childhood and can use it only with appropriate training. Psionic talents are generally seen as normal and accepted as any other skill, but some civilizations may be hostile to them.</p>
<p>Only a PC with WIL greater than 12, can be a psionic. The player makes a saving throw against WIL once during the generation to represent the activation of mental powers. If successful, the PC will possess a number of innate talents equal to WIL/3 (roll 1d20 on the list below). Talents cannot be taught or learned, only trained. The use of cybernetic brain implants inhibits the use of psionic powers, even once removed.</p>
<p>Everyone may use psionics and Willpower is the source. Each time an ability is used, the psion consumes WIL at the indicated cost. This determines the current level of WIL until recovered (the same rule for HP in <strong>Healing</strong> do apply). Usage that reduces a target's WIL below zero decreases a target's STR by the amount remaining (see <strong>Critical Damage</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="psionic-talents">Psionic Talents</h2>

<h1 id="vehicles--starships">Vehicles &amp; Starships</h1>
<p>Like creatures, vehicles have three <strong>abilities</strong> used to make <strong>saves</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity (INT)</strong>: General stability, used to crash safely, smash through things, and resist Critical Damage. Equivalent to STR for creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Engines (ENG)</strong>: Ability to move, speed up, dodge, and stunts. Equivalent to DEX for creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Systems (SYS)</strong>: Wirings, computers and sensors. Used to calculate routes, scan objects, and hacking. Equivalent to WIL for creatures.</p>
<h2 id="size-load--fuel">Size, Load &amp; Fuel</h2>
<p>Vehicles operate in different conditions depending on the type: ground (cars, tanks, etc.), water and air (boats, airplanes, etc.) and starships. They have three sizes: <strong>Small</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong> and <strong>Large</strong>.</p>
<p>Each scale grants a number of Load slots and consumes a different amount of fuel (to be considered abstract and indicative for non-spaceships).</p>

<p>Most modules &amp; weapons take up one slot, and small ones can be bundled together. <strong>Broad</strong> modules take up two slots. The vacant space can be used to carry cargo or passengers: 100 tons of cargo equal to 1 slot; 2 passengers occupy 1 slot. Crew does not occupy additional Load. A vehicle carrying a full load is reduced to 0 HP. A vehicle cannot carry more items than their Load allows.</p>
<p>A standard barrel is equivalent to 160 liters of fuel and and allows for a distance of 10 parsecs. The speed of spaceships traveling in oddspace is on average 1pc/hr. 10 barrels equal to 1 Load.</p>
<p>Vehicles of different scales are considered more agile in maneuvering than those of larger sizes.</p>
<h2 id="weapons-1">Weapons</h2>
<p>Weapons fall into two categories: normal and blast.</p>
<p>Normal weapons include lasers, blasters, particle beams, cannons, rail-guns, gatling guns, rockets and anything else where the act of firing results in damage in the same round. Combat is handle using the normal procedure.</p>
<p>Blast weapons include torpedoes, bombs and mass-drivers, the primary characteristic of which is that there is a delay (sometimes significant) between firing the weapon and the actual damage. They require the firing character to take a Lock Target action (see below) in one round, then fire the weapon on a later round. The lock must be maintained until the weapon hits.</p>
<h2 id="armor-3">Armor</h2>
<p>Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's <strong>Armor</strong> value from the result of damage rolls. No vehicle can have more than 5 Armor.<br />
Additional modules may provide additional benefits according to their use.</p>
<h2 id="hull">Hull</h2>
<p>As characters have Hit Protection, vehicles and starships possess Hull Points which reflect their ability to avoid damage in combat. As long as a vehicle still has Hull Points they continue to work just fine unless they take an Effect.</p>
<h2 id="overload">Overload</h2>
<p>A vehicle that exceeds the total value of Load possible for its scale is <strong>overloaded</strong> and it is unable to recover HP or ability scores. Anything overloaded for more than one day deactivates a module, one for each day. Each <strong>Deactivation</strong> occupies one Load slot and lasts until they are able to repair.</p>
<h2 id="reactions-1">Reactions</h2>
<p>When two vehicles encounter each other, the referee may roll 2d6 to determine the unknown side's attitude:</p>

<h2 id="critical-damage">Critical Damage</h2>
<p>Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's INT by the amount remaining. They must then make a INT save to avoid <strong>critical damage</strong>. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.</p>
<p>A vehicle reduced to zero Hull Points suffers an Effect. A vehicle with zero INT is scrap, or an expanding cloud of debris</p>
<h2 id="effect">Effect</h2>
<p>When damage to a vehicle reduces their HP to exactly 0, it gets an effect. Roll on the table below. Even though it is designed primarily for spaceships the same effects can be adapted to other vehicles.</p>
<p>| 1D6 | Critical Effect | | 1 | A secondary module: comms, life-support, scanners, shields or an area such as the sickbay or cargo bay is hit and out of action until repaired. Determine randomly. | | 2 | A weapon has been hit, determine which randomly. That weapon is unable to fire until repaired. | | 3 | Fire breaks out on-board, determine where randomly. Anyone in that area or fighting the fire without protection takes d6 damage every round until the fire is out. | | 4 | The engines take a hit. The vehicle cannot maneuver and, if flying in a gravitational field, will fall from the sky unless repaired. | | 5 | The hull is breached, determine where randomly. Anyone in the affected area will suffer the effects of the atmosphere (if toxic) or vacuum (if in space) until the breach is sealed. | | 6 | The vehicle’s controls explode in a shower of sparks &amp; debris. d6 damage to any crew member using them, Dexterity Save to avoid. |</p>
<h2 id="destruction-and-repairs">Destruction and Repairs</h2>
<p>Permanently restoring one damaged module or one point of Armor, HP or INT requires some time and an WIL Save.</p>
<p>How long it takes and how much it costs is up to the Referee, but typically each repair roll will take 2d6+6 hours and cost 1d6% of the vehicle’s original cost. The Referee should also determine if all the necessary parts are available and, if not, how they can be obtained.</p>
<h2 id="jury-rigging">Jury Rigging</h2>
<p>In combat or another emergency, it may not be possible to make repairs that will last, but there may just be time to jury rig something that works for as long as is needed.</p>
<p>Make an WIL Save to restore one Hull point, or a single damaged module. The repair lasts for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<h2 id="starship-modules">Starship Modules</h2>
<p>A starship may have one or more of the following modules installed. This is not an exhaustive list, so if something you want isn’t here just ask the Referee. While some modules act passively or are always on, others may require an ability save - typically WIL - to operate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cargo Bay</strong> (broad): An area of the vehicle set aside for cargo or other storage. May include equipment for moving cargo such as cranes, fork-lifts, loader exoskeletons or anti-grav handlers.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Drones</strong>: A number of small vehicles which are deployed en-masse for reconnaissance or combat purposes. The idea of combat drones is to carry the fight away from the main ship and overwhelm the enemy with a large number of attackers. Each drone launched becomes an independent weapon under the control of one or more gunners. Each gunner can control a number of drones equal to their WIL/3. Roll attack and damage for each drone as if they are an independent vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Crew Quarters</strong> (broad): Section of the vessel dedicated to crew cabins, including common areas. Present only in long-distance or particularly luxurious ships. In other cases the crew sleeps in bunks.</li>
<li><strong>Cryogenic/Stasis Chambers</strong> (broad): Provides enough chambers for all the crew and passengers to effectively sleep for the duration of a long journey without any aging effects or food &amp; water requirements.</li>
<li><strong>ECM Array</strong>: Electronic Counter-measures devices used to spy on, disrupt or jam enemy communications and scanners.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Power</strong>: A module of small backup power sources, distributed throughout the vehicle or ship, which provides minimal power when all other sources are unavailable. For most vehicles, this would mean minimal life-support and lighting only.</li>
<li><strong>Escape Pod</strong>: A small, low-powered lifeboat capable of automated sub-light travel to the nearest habitable world.</li>
<li><strong>Flight Deck or Shuttle Bay</strong> (broad): An area of the vehicle where other, smaller, vehicles such as fighters or shuttle craft can be launched and recovered.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Purchasable and installable on advanced worlds, this module allows all ship systems to be integrated with a self-aware artificial intelligence that can assist the crew and steer the ship when needed. IIAs are illegal in some areas.</li>
<li><strong>Interior Scanners</strong>: Cameras and/or sensors inside the vehicle which can be used to track passengers &amp; crew or other creatures on board.</li>
<li><strong>Laboratory or Science Facility</strong>: Facilities for carrying out some form of scientific investigation or study. May be a laboratory capable of a variety of basic scientific functions or several specific facilities each focused on one particular science, such as an Astrometrics Lab.</li>
<li><strong>Life Support</strong>: Seals the vehicle against the outside atmosphere (or lack thereof) and provides breathable air. May also provide a food &amp; water supply and waste reclamation facilities for an extended trip.</li>
<li><strong>Main Reactor</strong>: The main power source of the vehicle. Some vehicles may also have a secondary power source, usually less powerful than the main reactor, which can be used to supply power if the main reactor is inoperative.</li>
<li><strong>Odd Drive</strong> (broad): Allows the vehicle to travel faster than-light accessing the oddspace.</li>
<li><strong>Passenger Quarters</strong> (broad): Section of the vessel dedicated to the accommodation of passengers, complete with cabin with toilets and common area adjacent to the galley.</li>
<li><strong>Point Defence</strong>: Short-range cannons with a high rate-of-fire which are used to shoot down incoming targets such as torpedoes and fighters. Before a blast weapon hits, make a SYS vs SYS Save between the attacking ship and the target ship. If the target ship wins, the incoming weapon is destroyed, if not then that weapon hits it’s target. PDC’s attack incoming fighters with a SYS vs ENG Save.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Destruct</strong>: Arranges for the complete, usually explosive, destruction of the vehicle after a suitable escape delay.</li>
<li><strong>Sickbay</strong>: A medical facility equipped for some form of First Aid or medical procedures. A larger, better equipped, sickbay may include surgical, recovery and intensive care facilities. One hour in a sick bay allows a character to recover 1d6 STR. In 24 hours they can recover back to their maximum STR.</li>
<li><strong>Stealth Package</strong>: Makes the vehicle harder to locate or determine details by enemy scanners. All scan or lock-on attempts against it are impaired.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-light Drive</strong>: Moves the vehicle through space or an atmosphere at speeds less than that of light.</li>
<li><strong>Torpedoes</strong>: Blast weapons. Once a torpedo is locked on to a target the firing ship can move on and attack other targets while the torpedo tracks until it detonates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="starship-crew-actions">Starship Crew Actions</h2>
<p>Pilots maneuver their vehicles in hopes of avoiding enemy fire or to position the ship for the perfect shot. Technicians have their hands full jury rigging repairs, trying to keep modules running or boosting the engines for a desperate escape. Gunners, besides trying to blast the enemy to bits and pieces, may need to lock onto a target before trying to shoot them with a valuable but devastating torpedo, or try to restart the Tactical modules if they go offline. Communication officers may need to contact help, or try to jam the comm modules or scanners of rival ships.</p>
<p>The following are just some of the actions a vehicle’s crew can take, the Referee may allow others.</p>
<h3 id="boost-engines">Boost Engines</h3>
<p>Redirect the vehicle’s energy reserves to boost its engines temporarily. To do this the character makes a WIL Save . This lasts for 1d6 rounds. One other shipboard module becomes inoperative or unusable for the same period of time. On a critical failure, immediately reduce SYS of the vehicle by one point.</p>
<h3 id="boost-weapons">Boost Weapons</h3>
<p>Redirect the vehicle’s energy reserves to temporarily improve the power of a vehicle’s guns. Make a WILL Save. Increase the weapon damage by 1 die of it’s usual type (eg: if the weapon does 1d10 damage, it now does 2d10, if 1d6, it’s now 2d6). This lasts for 1d6 rounds, no longer. One other shipboard module becomes inoperative or unusable for the same period of time. On a critical failure, immediately reduce SYS of the vehicle by one point.</p>
<h3 id="dodge-and-jink">Dodge and Jink</h3>
<p>A pilot can perform sudden, chaotic maneuvers in order to avoid enemy fire. The opposing pilot makes a WIL Save. If they fails, enemy’s attacks are impaired.</p>
<h3 id="jam-comms-or-scanners">Jam Comms or Scanners</h3>
<p>A character operating the communication or scanner modules may try to jam an enemy ship’s modules by making a WIL Save. If successful this action makes the target ship unable to communicate as long as that character keeps jamming their channels; any attempts to use scanners, Lock on Target or attack by that ship are impaired. Requires the vehicle to be equipped with an ECM Array.</p>
<h3 id="lock-on-target">Lock on Target</h3>
<p>Gunners can spend a full round locking their vehicle’s targeting module to a specific target. When firing normal weapons, make a SYS Save and forgo all other actions that round, then next turn the attack against the specified target will be <strong>enhanced</strong>, or make an impaired attack to score an automatic Effect against a specific vehicle module (ignoring armor and shields).</p>
<p>When firing blast weapons, make a SYS Save and forgo all other actions that round. If a lock-on is achieved, the weapon may be fired as an action in a later round, provided the lock is maintained.</p>
<p>If the target’s pilot takes a successful Dodge action or otherwise increases their Engine value before the attack can hit, they break the target lock. Gunners must re-roll the lock-on save immediately, or lose the target lock.</p>
<p>As long as the weapon has a target lock at the point it reaches the target (even if it has lost and re-acquired that lock in between), it will damage. The referee will rule when a weapon has exceeded its maximum flight time.</p>
<h3 id="plot-a-course">Plot a Course</h3>
<p>The Pilot or Navigator makes an WIL Save to calculate an oddspace course and lock it into the helm navigation computer. At any point after that, the ship can activate it’s odd drive. The Referee can rule that this only takes one round, or may decide on longer, but typically 1d4 or 1d6 rounds are appropriate. The Pilot or Navigator can take no other actions while plotting a course. If they do, they must start over.</p>
<h3 id="ram">Ram</h3>
<p>In a desperate move, a pilot can attempt to take out another vehicle by ramming it without suffering too much damage themselves. Make a ENG Save against, inflicting half the ramming vehicle’s normal maximum Hull Points in damage on both vehicles. Armor will reduce this damage for both vehicles.</p>

<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
<h2 id="rounds">Rounds</h2>
<p>The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A <strong>round</strong> is a short time span (roughly ten seconds of in-game time for characters and ten minutes for starships) and is comprised of turns.</p>
<h2 id="distance-and-range">Distance and Range</h2>
<p>For ease of reference, range is relative and noted in three terms: <strong>close</strong>, <strong>nearby</strong>, and <strong>distant</strong>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>On their turn, a character may move up to nearby and take up to one action. This may be using psionics, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.</p>
<p>Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the referee calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.</p>
<h2 id="turns">Turns</h2>
<p>The referee will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or creatures. At the start of combat, each PC must make a DEX save to act before their opponents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br />
<em>Aniet has accidentally stumbled onto the stomping grounds of a massive Black Destroyer. In order to make a move before the Destroyer, she makes a DEX save. She fails, and the Destroyer gets to attack first.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="attacking--damage">Attacking &amp; Damage</h2>
<p>The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br />
<em>The Black Destroyer roars, drawing its claws and approaching Aniet, who has 5 HP. Claws do 1d6 damage and the referee rolls a 4. They subtract 1 to account for Aniet's light armor, leaving Aniet with 2 HP remaining</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="multiple-attackers">Multiple Attackers</h2>
<p>If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.</p>
<h2 id="attack-modifiers">Attack Modifiers</h2>
<p>If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is <strong>impaired</strong> and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die.</p>
<p>If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is <strong>enhanced</strong>, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.</p>
<h2 id="dual-weapons">Dual Weapons</h2>
<p>If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.</p>
<h2 id="blast">Blast</h2>
<p>Attacks with the <strong>blast</strong> quality affect all targets in the noted blast, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.</p>
<h2 id="critical-damage-1">Critical Damage</h2>
<p>Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's STR by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid <strong>critical damage</strong>. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.</p>
<p>Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.</p>
<h2 id="ability-score-loss">Ability Score Loss</h2>
<p>If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.</p>
<h2 id="scars">Scars</h2>
<p>When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the <a href="#scars-table"><strong>Scars Table</strong></a> table for more.</p>
<h2 id="unconsciousness--death">Unconsciousness &amp; Death</h2>
<p>When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of an Assistant. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.</p>
<h2 id="detachments">Detachments</h2>
<p>Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single <strong>detachment</strong>. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.</p>
<p>Attacks against detachments by individuals are <strong>impaired</strong> (excluding blast damage).<br />
Attacks against individuals by detachments are <strong>enhanced</strong> and deal blast damage.</p>
<h2 id="retreat">Retreat</h2>
<p>Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.</p>
<h2 id="scars-table">Scars Table</h2>
<p>When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total damage taken:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Lasting Scar: Roll 1d6 | 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.</td>

<h1 id="worlds--systems">Worlds &amp; Systems</h1>
<p>The enormous expanses that access to oddspace has made traversable have generated the need to map the vastness of the Five Galaxies. This chapter will provide the fundamentals for managing the geography of space and generating star systems.</p>
<h2 id="space-geography">Space Geography</h2>
<p>Normal space is subdivided into 10pc-sided cubes, called sub-sectors.</p>
<p>Below is the conventional scale in which the Charted Space is subdivided:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub-sector</strong>: A region of 10pc<sup>3</sup> space in which there are several star systems.</li>
<li><strong>Sector</strong>: A region of 100pc<sup>3</sup> space or 1000 sub-sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster</strong>: Aggregation of 2 or more sectors, usually defined by political entities.</li>
<li><strong>Quadrant</strong>: A quarter of a galaxy, containing several sectors each.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/sector_dia.svg" alt="visual representation of a sector" /></p>
<p>To this geography is added the topography of the Wormhole Access Network (WAN). Numerous natural and man-made wormholes are maintained to connect distant sectors and shorten travel times. Usually travel between wormholes is instantaneous and subject to a fee. A pair of wormholes is in exclusive communication, often natural wormholes are single way, while artificial wormholes are always double way, unless disabled on purpose.</p>
<h2 id="astrography">Astrography</h2>
<p>Space is usually mapped at the local sub-sector level. To represent a three-dimensional space, it is possible to "press" the representation into two dimensions, representing the distances between nearest stars as edges of a graph.</p>
<p><img src="img/subsector_dia.svg" alt="subsector diagram" /></p>
<p>To determine the configuration of a sub-sector:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll 2d20 to determine the number of stars of the region.</li>
<li>For each star roll 1d6, then add the values ​​of two nearby stars to calculate the distance in light-years between them.</li>
<li>Draw the resulting graph, noting the distances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Optionally, it is possible to drop a number of colored d6s (representing the spectral class of the stars) on a sheet of paper, thus drawing the edges of the graph between them and marking the sum value of each pair.</p>
<h2 id="stellar-systems">Stellar Systems</h2>
<p>The generation of features for a star system can be randomly determined using this procedure. Roll on the relevant tables where necessary.<br />
When prompted 1d3, roll 1d6, divide by two and round down.</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll for number of stars in the system.</li>
<li>Roll for spectral type and color.</li>
<li>Roll 1d6+4 to determine the number of planets.</li>
<li>Roll 1d6 to determine the number of habitats.
<ul>
<li>If one of them is a ringworld/Dyson sphere, there are no other planets in the system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Roll for planet type.
<ul>
<li>Roll 1d3 to determine how many worlds are in the habitable zone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Roll for planet features.</li>
<li>Roll to determine moons: -. For gas/ice giant planets, roll 1d20 to termine the number of moons. Roll for determine type and features of each. -. For terrestrial planets, roll 1d3. Then roll for type and features. -. For dwarf planets, roll 1-6. If result is 6 they have one satellite. -. Habitats and asteroid belts have no moons.</li>
<li>Roll on Population table to determine each moon inhabitants. They always capped to 10mln.</li>
</ol>
<p>Giant/dwarf planets and asteroids are naturally uninhabitable, but they are settled using domed and underground facilities (see Colonies below).</p>

<h3 id="space-stations--bases">Space Stations &amp; Bases</h3>
<p>Space stations are quite common in any star system and cannot be determined with a specific algorithm. Usually there can 1d20 stations per planet. They are usually installed in orbit, on the surface of inhospitable planets and at strategic points such as Langrange Points. To inspire the referee who needs it, here are some examples.</p>

<h1 id="creatures">Creatures</h1>
<p>TDB</p>
<h2 id="creating-creatures">Creating Creatures</h2>
<p>Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Creature or NPC:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong> X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor</li>
<li>Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique</li>
<li>Special effect or critical damage consequence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Principles</strong><br />
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious threats get 10+ HP.</li>
<li>Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.</li>
<li>Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.</li>
<li>Remember that HP is <strong>Hit Protection</strong> , not Hit Points. It's a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Converting from OSR Games</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give 1 HP per HD for most creatures.</li>
<li>Most humanoids have at least 4HP.</li>
<li><strong>Morale</strong> can also be used as a baseline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it good at avoiding a hit? Give it HP.</li>
<li>Does it soak up damage? Give it Armor.</li>
<li>Is it strong? Give it a high <strong>STR</strong>.</li>
<li>Is it nimble? Give it high <strong>DEX</strong>.</li>
<li>Is it charismatic? Give it high <strong>WIL</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Damage die are roughly the same, though armed attacks do at least 1d6 damage.</p>

<h1 id="rules-summary">Rules Summary</h1>
<h2 id="actions-1">ACTIONS</h2>
<p>On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Retreating</strong> from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.</p>
<h2 id="abilities-1">ABILITIES</h2>
<p><strong>STR:</strong> Brawn, prowess &amp; resistance.<br />
<strong>DEX:</strong> Dodging, sneaking &amp; reflexes.<br />
<strong>WIL:</strong> Persuasion, intimidation &amp; magic.</p>
<h2 id="saves-1">SAVES</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.</li>
<li>1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hit-protection-1">HIT PROTECTION</h2>
<p><strong>HP</strong> indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat &amp; recovered after a few moment's rest.</p>
<h2 id="inventory-1">INVENTORY</h2>
<p>PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. <strong>Bulky</strong> items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.</p>
<p>Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts &amp; horses may provide an increase in slots.</p>
<h2 id="deprivation">DEPRIVATION</h2>
<p><strong>Deprived</strong> PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they add a <strong>Fatigue</strong> to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.</p>
<h2 id="healing-1">HEALING</h2>
<p>A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. <strong>Ability</strong> loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a skilled healer.</p>
<h2 id="cybernetics-1">CYBERNETICS</h2>
<p>Cybernetics are expensive body augmentations that increase power and capabilities. Deterioration and hacking need to pass a saving throw against STR to avoid <strong>Critical Damage</strong>.</p>
<p>Augmentations have a cost of purchase and installation, as well as periodic maintenance. Installation has a recovery time of 1d6 days. Missing revisions results in malfunctioning implants, forcing a saving throw every 1d6 days until maintenance or removal.</p>
<h2 id="psionics-1">PSIONICS</h2>
<p>Psionics allow control of matter and mind. Only a PC with WIL greater than 12, can be a psionic, if a saving throw against WIL succeeds (WIL/3 talents randomly selected from the Talents Table). Talents cannot be taught or learned, only trained and are inhibited by cybernetic brain implants.</p>
<p>The psion consumes WIL at the indicated cost determing the current level of WIL until recovered. Each excess point decreases STR (<strong>Critical Damage</strong> rules apply).</p>
<h2 id="combat-1">COMBAT</h2>
<p>The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.</p>
<p>Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's <strong>Armor</strong> value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.</p>
<p>No one can have more than 3 Armor.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed</strong> attacks always do 1d4 damage. If <strong>multiple attackers</strong> target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with <strong>two weapons</strong> at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.</p>
<p>If an attack is <strong>impaired</strong> , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is <strong>enhanced</strong>, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the <strong>blast</strong> quality affect all blast targets, rolling separately for each.</p>
<h2 id="damage">DAMAGE</h2>
<p>If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player rolls on the <a href="#scars-table"><strong>Scars Table</strong></a> table.</p>
<p>Damage that reduces a target's HP <strong>below</strong> 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid <strong>critical damage.</strong> Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.</p>
<p>Having STR 0 means <strong>death;</strong> having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.</p>
