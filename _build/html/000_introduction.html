<p>Intrepid spacers ply the vastness of the Five Galaxies in search of fortune and glory.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Plerion</strong>, a sci-fi hack from <a href="https://cairnrpg.com"><em>Cairn</em></a> designed to play rutilant space opera.</p>
<p>Inspired by classic science fiction and the RPGs that emulate it, but with a more modern twist, winking at transhumanism and cyberpunk.</p>
<p><em>Plerion</em> is an adventure game for one <strong>referee</strong> and at least one other player. Players act as hardened spacers exploring, exploiting and commerce through the vastness of space in the far future.</p>
