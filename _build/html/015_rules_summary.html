<h1 id="rules-summary">Rules Summary</h1>
<h2 id="actions">ACTIONS</h2>
<p>On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Retreating</strong> from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.</p>
<h2 id="abilities">ABILITIES</h2>
<p><strong>STR:</strong> Brawn, prowess &amp; resistance.<br />
<strong>DEX:</strong> Dodging, sneaking &amp; reflexes.<br />
<strong>WIL:</strong> Persuasion, intimidation &amp; magic.</p>
<h2 id="saves">SAVES</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.</li>
<li>1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hit-protection">HIT PROTECTION</h2>
<p><strong>HP</strong> indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat &amp; recovered after a few moment's rest.</p>
<h2 id="inventory">INVENTORY</h2>
<p>PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. <strong>Bulky</strong> items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.</p>
<p>Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts &amp; horses may provide an increase in slots.</p>
<h2 id="deprivation">DEPRIVATION</h2>
<p><strong>Deprived</strong> PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they add a <strong>Fatigue</strong> to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.</p>
<h2 id="healing">HEALING</h2>
<p>A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. <strong>Ability</strong> loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a skilled healer.</p>
<h2 id="cybernetics">CYBERNETICS</h2>
<p>Cybernetics are expensive body augmentations that increase power and capabilities. Deterioration and hacking need to pass a saving throw against STR to avoid <strong>Critical Damage</strong>.</p>
<p>Augmentations have a cost of purchase and installation, as well as periodic maintenance. Installation has a recovery time of 1d6 days. Missing revisions results in malfunctioning implants, forcing a saving throw every 1d6 days until maintenance or removal.</p>
<h2 id="psionics">PSIONICS</h2>
<p>Psionics allow control of matter and mind. Only a PC with WIL greater than 12, can be a psionic, if a saving throw against WIL succeeds (WIL/3 talents randomly selected from the Talents Table). Talents cannot be taught or learned, only trained and are inhibited by cybernetic brain implants.</p>
<p>The psion consumes WIL at the indicated cost determing the current level of WIL until recovered. Each excess point decreases STR (<strong>Critical Damage</strong> rules apply).</p>
<h2 id="combat">COMBAT</h2>
<p>The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.</p>
<p>Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's <strong>Armor</strong> value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.</p>
<p>No one can have more than 3 Armor.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed</strong> attacks always do 1d4 damage. If <strong>multiple attackers</strong> target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with <strong>two weapons</strong> at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.</p>
<p>If an attack is <strong>impaired</strong> , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is <strong>enhanced</strong>, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the <strong>blast</strong> quality affect all blast targets, rolling separately for each.</p>
<h2 id="damage">DAMAGE</h2>
<p>If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player rolls on the <a href="#scars-table"><strong>Scars Table</strong></a> table.</p>
<p>Damage that reduces a target's HP <strong>below</strong> 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid <strong>critical damage.</strong> Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.</p>
<p>Having STR 0 means <strong>death;</strong> having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.</p>
