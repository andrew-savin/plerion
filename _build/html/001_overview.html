<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Plerion</strong> was written with the following design philosophies in mind:</p>
<h3 id="neutrality">Neutrality</h3>
<p>The referee's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.</p>
<h3 id="classless">Classless</h3>
<p>A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.</p>
<h3 id="fiction-first">Fiction First</h3>
<p>Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the referee in dialogue with the players, based on in-universe elements.</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>Characters are changed through in-universe advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="player-choice">Player Choice</h3>
<p>Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.</p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<p>The referee and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.</p>
<h3 id="shared-objectives">Shared Objectives</h3>
<p>Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.</p>
