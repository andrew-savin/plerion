<h1 id="psionics">Psionics</h1>
<p>Psionics is the art of using the mind over matter and spirit. It is a latent ability in all sentient beings, but not everyone can use it. Usually the subject demonstrates the psionic ability in childhood and can use it only with appropriate training. Psionic talents are generally seen as normal and accepted as any other skill, but some civilizations may be hostile to them.</p>
<p>Only a PC with WIL greater than 12, can be a psionic. The player makes a saving throw against WIL once during the generation to represent the activation of mental powers. If successful, the PC will possess a number of innate talents equal to WIL/3 (roll 1d20 on the list below). Talents cannot be taught or learned, only trained. The use of cybernetic brain implants inhibits the use of psionic powers, even once removed.</p>
<p>Everyone may use psionics and Willpower is the source. Each time an ability is used, the psion consumes WIL at the indicated cost. This determines the current level of WIL until recovered (the same rule for HP in <strong>Healing</strong> do apply). Usage that reduces a target's WIL below zero decreases a target's STR by the amount remaining (see <strong>Critical Damage</strong>).</p>
