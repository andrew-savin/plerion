<h2 id="making-creatures">Making Creatures</h2>
<p>Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Creature or NPC:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong> X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor</li>
<li>Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique</li>
<li>Special effect or critical damage consequence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Principles</strong><br />
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious threats get 10+ HP.</li>
<li>Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.</li>
<li>Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.</li>
<li>Remember that HP is <strong>Hit Protection</strong> , not Hit Points. It's a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Converting from OSR Games</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give 1 HP per HD for most creatures.</li>
<li>Most humanoids have at least 4HP.</li>
<li><strong>Morale</strong> can also be used as a baseline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it good at avoiding a hit? Give it HP.</li>
<li>Does it soak up damage? Give it Armor.</li>
<li>Is it strong? Give it a high <strong>STR</strong>.</li>
<li>Is it nimble? Give it high <strong>DEX</strong>.</li>
<li>Is it charismatic? Give it high <strong>WIL</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Damage die are roughly the same, though armed attacks do at least 1d6 damage.</p>
