<h3 id="information">Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide useful information about the game universe as the characters explore it.</li>
<li>Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.</li>
<li>Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.</li>
<li>Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h3>
<ul>
<li>Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.</li>
<li>If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.</li>
<li>Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.</li>
<li>Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The game universe is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.</li>
<li>Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.</li>
<li>NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the universe.</li>
<li>NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="narrative-focus">Narrative Focus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players,then put realistic opportunities in their path.</li>
<li>A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="danger">Danger</h3>
<ul>
<li>The game universe produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.</li>
<li>Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.</li>
<li>Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.</li>
<li>Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the universe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reward">Reward</h3>
<ul>
<li>A reward is specific to the mission for is granted. It tells a story.</li>
<li>Reward is highly valuable and is worth wealth and prestige.</li>
<li>Artifacts are not Rewards, though they are useful and interesting.</li>
<li>Use Reward as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choice">Choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.</li>
<li>Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.</li>

<li>Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game universe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="die-of-fate">Die of Fate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge,etc.).</li>
<li>In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.</li>
<li>A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principles-for-players">Principles for Players</h2>
<h3 id="agency">Agency</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="talking">Talking</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="caution">Caution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.</li>
<li>Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.</li>

<li>Alien creatures, pathogens and unfamiliar technology are the order of the day in uncharted regions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="charted-space-is-not-so-well-known">Charted Space is not so well-known</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are five galaxies in the Charted Space.</li>
<li>There are billions of unknown system in there ready to be explored (and exploited).</li>

<ul>
<li>The discovery of <em>oddspace</em> opened the door to interstellar travel, at 1 parsec/hour.</li>

<li>The Charted Space is dotted with military, commercial and industrial stations that form the nodes of the travel network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="humans-are-not-alone">Humans are not alone</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="interspecies-relationships-are-complex">Interspecies relationships are complex</h3>
<ul>
<li>The species of known space are amalgamated in a precarious multiculturalism that generates both growth and conflict.</li>
<li>Cosmopolitanism is a dominant trait of empires, distrust or xenophobia of smaller nations.</li>
<li>Spacers are usually open and welcoming and have no problem working with people of other species.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="profits-are-risky">Profits are risky</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spacers have different ways of making profit, but all of them are risky.</li>

<li>Interstellar trade, search for artifacts, or exploration missions are another common activity of spacers.</li>
</ul>
