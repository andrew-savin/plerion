<p>Body parts can be replaced or grafted with advanced technological products that increase their power and capabilities. Beings augmented in this way receive the benefits, but are also subject to deterioration and hacking, as well as potential overloads and sensitivity to magnetic fields. In these cases, a saving throw against STR must be passed to avoid <strong>Critical Damage</strong>.</p>
<p>Augmentations have a cost of purchase and installation, as well as periodic maintenance (see Equipment). Installation has a recovery time of 1d6 days within which absolute rest is required. Missing revisions results in malfunctioning implants, forcing a saving throw every 1d6 days until maintenance or removal.</p>
