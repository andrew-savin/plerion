# Appendix B: Creatures & NPC Conversion Guides
If you want to convert encounters from the most popular science fiction game systems, see the guidelines below.

## Converting from Traveller
Converting from Traveller (both Classic and Mongoose) modules is quite straightforward:
- STR = Strength + Endurance
- DEX = Dexterity x 2
- WIL = Intelligence + Social Standing
- Education is not considered
- HP = Endurance/2
- Considering that Armors is capped at 3, a direct conversion is not possible, but consider this scale:
  - Jack has a value of 1 Armor.
  - Cloth has a value of 2 Armor.
  - Battle Dress has a value of 3 Armor.
- Skills must be converted as fictional guidelines (es. foe with a high Athletic skill is fast & nimble etc.)
- Weapon can be adapted to their analogue in Plerion. See [Equipment](004_equipment.md).

## Converting from Mothership
This guide is adapted from **Meteor Corp** (CC-BY-SA 4.0 by David Lombardo).

### Default NPC
When in doubt, an NPC has the following stats:
3 HP, 0 Armor, d6 weapon, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL , 5 HP

Adjust stats for NPCs or creatures that have notable or significant differences.
Most NPCs and creatures can be differentiated by actions, motivations, and
behavior rather than needing to adjust stats.

### Adjusting Stats
Evasive enemies have more HP. Armor can also be used to represent particularly
evasive enemies. Avoid large amounts of HP as it can cause combat to become
boring and repetitive. Remember that HP is not meat or physical resilience, it’s a
creature’s ability to avoid harm.

Deadly enemies have stronger weapons, or Critical Damage effects. Use Blast
damage for explosives, sweeping beams, or giant slashing claws. Damage
ranges from a d4 for unarmed attacks, to a d12 for massive damage.

Strong enemies have 15 STR, weak have 5.

Skilled enemies have 15 DEX, drones have 5. It is usually not necessary to
specify the specific Skills NPCs have, instead make rulings based on what would
plausibly be within their area of expertise.

Brave enemies have 15 WIL, cowardly have 5.

Add Specials to represent unique abilities, technologies, or tactics NPCs might
have access to.
