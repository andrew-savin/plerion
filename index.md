Intrepid spacers ply the vastness of the Five Galaxies in search of fortune and glory: this is **Plerion**, a sci-fi hack from [*Cairn*](https://cairnrpg.com) designed to play rutilant space opera.

It's inspired by classic science fiction and the RPGs that emulate it, but with a more modern twist, winking at transhumanism and cyberpunk.

Sources of inspiration:
- Classic Traveller
- Jack Vance's Gaen Reach
- Mass Effect
- Becky Chambers's Wayfarer Series
- David Brin's Uplift Series
