# Spacefaring Adventures

In the Five Galaxies spacefaring travel is as commons as traveling by plane nowadays. Planets, regions and nation communicate and trade through routes, which are discovered continuously through the oddspace. Due to the limit capacity of fuel tanks, it is commonly recommend to trace routes to end travel in well-known star systems, or at least in one served by a base to refuel.

Nevertheless, venture out on a mission is a risky business that involves facing uncharted expanses, landing on unknown planets facing its alien culture, or face the dangers of an abandoned installation or a derelict, or even face the risk of encountering hostile ships and pirates.

Generally, the referee will provide a map of the local sub-sector with a clear indication of the presence of service stations and the known dangers. It can be assumed that the Charted Space map was purchased and installed on the ship's systems, but this obviously will not contain data on uncharted  star systems, or secret or illegal installations.

## Contingencies in space

Each time a starship exits oddspace, the referee should determine a random event that will affect the next moves of the adventure. This system is intended as a guideline. The referee will interpret the result in a way that best suits the fiction.

| 2D6   | Event                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Ship malfunction (deactivate one module) |
| 4-6   | Space Anomaly                            |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)             |
| 8-10  | Distress call                            |
| 11-12 | Advantage                                |

Space anomalies should be interpreted according to the fiction. Events such as solar storms or asteroid fields can have equally important effects on the course of the adventure (e.g., a storm disrupts the ship's systems, the asteroid field must be bypassed or crossed at reduced speed adding 1d6 hours to the journey, etc.).

An advantage is anything positive to the mission or to travel purpose (such a patron's call with an offer, appearing on the sensors of an allied base, etc.). 

## Landing & Exploration
Not only explorers and trailblazers will face situations in which they will have to land and explore unknown and potentially hostile planets. In these cases it is possible that the group needs to cross unknown territories. Every travel day, the referee should roll on the following events to determine contingencies.

| 2D6   | Event                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Transport malfunction         |
| 4-6   | Shift weather                 |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)  |
| 8-10  | Clue regarding next encounter |
| 11-12 | Advantage                     |

An advantage is anything positive to the mission or to travel purpose (such as meeting a friendly population, finding game, finding a healing compound, etc.).

## Salvaging
Some missions require the boarding of derelict for their salvage or dispossession. Furthermore, even call-for-help events could lead to dealing with similar environments. For each room or environment explored, the referee should roll on the following event table to determine the type of occurrence.

| 2D6   | Event                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Exhaustion (need to rest)     |
| 4-6   | Local change                  |
| 7     | Encounter (roll on reaction)  |
| 8-10  | Clue regarding next encounter |
| 11-12 | Advantage                     |

Encounter tables should be built thematically based on the type of mission and derelict explored (such as an alien infestation, a terrorist boarding, a failed experiment in a laboratory that released pathogens or psychotropics, etc.).
