# Cybernetics
Body parts can be replaced or grafted with advanced technological products that increase their power and capabilities. Beings augmented in this way receive the benefits, but are also subject to deterioration and hacking, as well as potential overloads and sensitivity to magnetic fields. In these cases, a saving throw against STR must be passed to avoid **Critical Damage**.

Augmentations have a cost of purchase and installation, as well as periodic maintenance (see Equipment). 
Installation has a recovery time of 1d6 days within which absolute rest is required. 
Missing revisions results in malfunctioning implants, forcing a saving throw every 1d6 days until maintenance or removal.

### Implants
1. **Air Filter**: It provides immunity to toxic or non-breathable atmospheres.
2. **Augmented Reflexes**: Nerve implants that improve above average reflexes of the subject. Permanent +2 DEX until removal, wear or malfunction.
3. **Blade Implant**: A melee weapon of your choice is implanted in the body. Remains hidden until use.
4. **Brain Augmentation**: Improves the holder's cognitive and mental abilities. Permanent +2 WIL until removal, wear or malfunction.
5. **Cloacking**: Implanted on the derma, allows light to be refracted, effectively becoming invisible. Use only in the nude, for up to 10 consecutive minutes per day.
6. **Cortical Implant**: Displays on retinas a complete HUD to control other implants, but also of basic life functions, enhancing them.
7. **Dermal Plating**: A subdermal layer of protection is installed beneath the entire body surface. +1 Armor.
8. **Detoxifier**: This artificial "liver" is capable of filtering out any toxins in the body, including radioactivity.
9. **Direct Neural Interface**: Implant for direct interfacing of the carrier's mind with weapon, vehicle, and spaceship systems.
10. **Ear Implant**: Provides enhanced hearing including subsonic and ultrasonic frequencies.
11. **Eye Implant**: Provides enhanced vision, including infrared, ultraviolet and nightvision.
12. **Firearm Implant**: A ranged weapon of your choice is implanted in the body. Remains hidden until use.
13. **Integrated Comms**: A standard long-range communicator embedded directly in the hearing aid.
14. **Mindshield**: Provides full shielding from psionic talents that allow for reading and mind control.
15. **Neural Datalink**: Provides direct mind-network access, ensuring the ability to dive into cyberspace.
16. **Prosthetic Limb**: Replaces an ordinary limb with an artificial copy with greater power and agility. +1 DEX and STR for each limb.
17. **Reinforced Skeleton**: The entire bone skeleton is plated with a super-strong alloy. + 2 STR.
18. **Repair Nanobots**: These restorative nanites are injected into the bloodstream. Instant recovery of HP after damage resolution.
19. **Spacesense**: Series of implants designed for space navigation, including a built-in autonomous route planner.
20. **Stimulants Dispenser**: Temporarily increases (1 combat tun) the responsiveness of the nervous system (+1 DEX) for up to two consecutive times and three per day.
