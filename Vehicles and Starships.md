## Vehicles and Starships
Vehicles and Starships are defined by the abilities:
Maneuvering, Tactical, Hull, Armour & Shields,
Quality, and Systems.

### Maneuvering
Some vehicles are capable of incredible speed
and maneuvers while others look like a fish, move
like a fish and steer like a cow. In game terms this
is represented by a vehicle’s Maneuvering ability.
Maneuvering limits the pilots Dexterity when they
try to maneuver the ship quickly or are dodging incoming
weapons fire. A Maneuvering Save uses
either the pilot’s Dexterity or the vehicle’s Maneuvering,
whichever is the lowest.

### Tactical
Firing weapons against incredibly fast moving targets
is not an easy task so most combat vehicles
have a Tactical system to assist gunners and pilots
hit their enemies. In game terms this is represented
by a vehicle’s Tactical ability. This effectively
limits the Wisdom used by anyone firing
mounted weapons on said vehicle or starship.

### Attacking
Whenever a gunner tries to shoot an enemy vehicle
with their own vehicle mounted weapons they
must make a Tactical Save using either their Wisdom
or the vehicle’s Tactical, whichever is the
lowest, rolled against the target pilot’s Dexterity or
their vehicle’s Maneuvering, whichever is the lowest.
Alternatively, the defending vehicle’s pilot can
make a Maneuvering Save against the attackers
Tactical or Wisdom using either their Dexterity or
their vehicle’s Maneuvering, whichever is lowest.

Example: Duke Starkiller (Dexterity 16/+6) in his
V-wing fighter (Maneuvering 13/+3, Tactical 14/+4)
is being fired upon by Garth Madeup (Wisdom
17/+7) in his Twin-Turbine Fighter (Maneuvering
13/+3, Tactical 15/+5). When Garth fires, he
makes a Wisdom Save at +5 (his +7 Wisdom
bonus limited by his fighter’s +5 Tactical ability)
against Duke’s fighter’s Maneuvering of 13 (which
is less than Duke’s Dexterity of 16).

Example: Alternatively, when Garth attacks, Duke
could roll a save at +3, using the lower of his +6
Dexterity bonus and the fighter’s Maneuvering
bonus of +3, against Garth’s fighter’s Tactical Defence
of 15 to dodge the attack.

### Weapons
There are so many different types of vehicle and
starship weapons it would be futile to try to cover
them all specifically here. They do, however, fall
into two categories: Direct Fire and Fire-and-Forget.

Direct Fire weapons include lasers, blasters, particle
beams, cannons, rail-guns, gatling guns,
rockets and anything else where the act of firing
results in a hit in the same round.

Fire-and-forget weapons include torpedoes,
bombs and mass-drivers, the primary characteristic
of which is that there is a delay (sometimes significant)
between firing the weapon and the actual
hit.

Direct weapons fire is handled using the normal
combat procedure: the attacker rolls to hit (or the
defender rolls to defend) and if a hit is scored the
damage is rolled and applied immediately.

Fire-and-forget weapons require the firing character
to take a Lock Target action (see below) in
one turn, then fire the weapon on a later turn (it
need not be their next turn). The Referee will determine
how long the weapon takes to reach it’s
target, then damage is calculated and applied.
The lock must be maintained until the weapon
hits.

### Armour and Shields
Both Armour and Shields act as additional Hull
Points which absorb damage before the actual hull
does.

Hits against a vehicle equipped with Armour and/
or Shields will reduce the shield rating first, then
the armour, then score against the Hull Points.

Armour can only be restored by repairing it, usually
at a shipyard or vehicle maintenance facility.
Shields restore automatically at the rate of 1 point
of shield at the start of each combat round up to
the maximum shield rating.

### Hull
As characters have Hit Points, vehicles and starships
possess Hull Points which measure how
much damage they can suffer before falling apart.
As long as a vehicle still has Hull Points they continue
to work just fine unless they take a Critical
Hit.

### Quality
A vehicle has an overall Quality rating which defines
how well it’s holding together and the effectiveness
of it’s systems. This can drop as a result
of poor maintenance, intentional abuse or damage
taken in the form of Critical Hits.

The Referee will let you know when your vehicle
loses Quality from wear and tear, normally after a
period of use (such as every month) or because of
physical abuse. To carry out corrective maintenance,
make an Intelligence Save to restore one
point of Quality. Time taken and cost are up to the
Referee, but it’s usually cheaper than repairs done
later.

As a vehicle’s Quality drops, so does the effectiveness
of it’s systems. For every point of Quality lost
the vehicle’s Maneuver and Tactical ratings drop
by 1/-1 and any saves carried out using on-board
systems such as scanners or the medical equipment
in the sickbay are made at a -1 penalty until
the damage can be repaired (or jury-rigged).

Example: Duke Starkiller’s V-wing fighter has
taken two critical hits which have knocked out one
of his laser cannons and the shield generator.
He’s also lost 2 points of Quality from those hits so
his Maneuvering is now 11/+1 and Tactical is
12/+2, and if he tries to contact help on his comms
he makes that Intelligence Save at -2.

### Systems
A vehicle may have one or more of the following
systems installed. This is not an exhaustive list, so
if something you want isn’t here just ask the Referee.
While some systems act passively or are always
on, others may require an ability save -
typically Intelligence - to operate.
- Life Support: Seals the vehicle against the outside
atmosphere (or lack thereof) and provides
breathable air. May also provide a food & water
supply and waste reclamation facilities for an extended
trip.
- Sub-light Drive: Moves the vehicle through
space or an atmosphere at speeds less than
that of light.
- FTL Drive: Allows the vehicle to travel fasterthan-
light. This may be a Warp Drive (the vehicle
remains in normal space, just moving very
quickly), a Hyperdrive (the vehicle moves to an
alternate dimension where the journey is
shorter), a Jump Drive (the vehicle disappears in
one place and reappears some time later in another)
or any other weird and wonderful way of
travelling interstellar distances.
- Cryogenic/Stasis Chambers: Provides enough
chambers for all the crew and passengers to effectively
sleep for the duration of a long journey
without any aging effects or food & water requirements.
- ECM Array: Electronic Counter-measures devices
used to spy on, disrupt or jam enemy communications
and scanners.
- Stealth Package: Makes the vehicle harder to
locate or determine details by enemy scanners.
All scan or lock-on attempts against it are made
at Disadvantage.
- Main Reactor: The main power source of the
vehicle. Although referred to here as a “reactor”
this may be anything from a steam engine to an
antimatter reaction chamber. Some vehicles
may also have a secondary power source, usually
less powerful than the main reactor, which
can be used to supply power if the main reactor
is inoperative.
- Emergency Power: A system of small backup
power sources, distributed throughout the vehicle
or ship, which provides minimal power when
all other sources are unavailable. For most vehicles,
this would mean minimal life-support and
lighting only.
- Self-Destruct: Arranges for the complete, usually
explosive, destruction of the vehicle after a
suitable escape delay.
- Flight Deck or Shuttle Bay: An area of the vehicle
where other, smaller, vehicles such as
fighters or shuttle craft can be launched and recovered.
- Sickbay: A medical facility equipped for some
form of First Aid or medical procedures. A larger,
better equipped, sickbay may include surgical,
recovery and intensive care facilities. One hour
in a sick bay allows a character to recover 1d8 +
their Constitution bonus Hit Points. In 24 hours
they can recover back to their maximum Hit
Points.
- Laboratory or Science Facility: Facilities for
carrying out some form of scientific investigation
or study. May be a laboratory capable of a variety
of basic scientific functions or several specific
facilities each focused on one particular
science, such as an Astrometrics Lab.
- Cargo Bay: An area of the vehicle set aside for
cargo or other storage. May include equipment
for moving cargo such as cranes, fork-lifts,
loader exoskeletons or anti-grav handlers.
- Point Defence: Short-range cannons with a
high rate-of-fire which are used to shoot down
incoming targets such as torpedoes and fighters.
Before a fire-and-forget weapon hits, make a
Tactical vs Tactical Save between the attacking
ship and the target ship. If the target ship wins,
the incoming weapon is destroyed, if not then
that weapon hits it’s target. PDC’s attack incoming
fighters with a Tactical vs Maneuvering Save.
- Torpedoes: Fire & forget weapons. Once a torpedo
is locked on to a target the firing ship can
move on and attack other targets while the torpedo
tracks until it detonates.
- Interior Scanners: Cameras and/or sensors inside
the vehicle which can be used to track passengers
& crew or other creatures on board.
- Combat Drones: A number of small vehicles
which are deployed en-masse for reconnaissance
or combat purposes. The idea of combat
drones is to carry the fight away from the main
ship and overwhelm the enemy with a large
number of attackers. Each drone launched becomes
an independent weapon under the control
of one or more gunners. Each gunner can
control a number of drones equal to their Wisdom
bonus. Roll attack and damage for each
drone as if they are an independent vehicle..
- Teleporter: A faster (and some would say safer)
way of moving personnel or cargo across space.
Step into the teleporter, make an Intelligence
Save to lock on to a target location and one turn
later you’re somewhere else.
- Escape Pod: A small, low-powered lifeboat capable
of automated sub-light travel to the nearest
habitable world.

### Critical Hits
During an attack roll, if the attacker rolls a natural
20 (or the defender rolls a natural 1) the attacker
rolls 1d6 on the table below and the target vehicle
Quality drops by 1. Vehicles reduced to zero Quality
are barely limping along and will be immediately
destroyed if they take additional damage that
drops their Hull Points to zero.

If a vehicle or ship suffers any damage after
reaching zero Hull Points it is considered to have
suffered another automatic Critical Hit, rolling on
the table below and losing another point of Quality.

| 1D6 | Critical Effect                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1   | A secondary system: comms, life-support, scanners, shields or an area such as the sickbay or cargo bay is hit and out of action until repaired. Determine randomly.                  |
| 2   | A weapon has been hit, determine which randomly. That weapon is unable to fire until repaired.                                                                                       |
| 3   | Fire breaks out on-board, determine where randomly. Anyone in that area or fighting the fire without protection takes d6 damage every round until the fire is out.                   |
| 4   | The engines take a hit. The vehicle cannot maneuver and, if flying in a gravitational field, will fall from the sky unless repaired.                                                 |
| 5   | The hull is breached, determine where randomly. Anyone in the affected area will suffer the effects of the atmosphere (if toxic) or vacuum (if in space) until the breach is sealed. |
| 6   | The vehicle’s controls explode in a shower of sparks & debris. d6 damage to any crew member using them, Dexterity Save to avoid.                                                     |

### Destruction and Repairs
A vehicle reduced to zero Hull Points or zero Quality
is out of action but salvageable - with a lot of
work. A vehicle with zero Hull Points and zero
Quality is scrap, or an expanding cloud of debris.

Permanently restoring one damaged system or
one point of Armour, Hull or Quality requires some
time and an Intelligence Save. The right specialist
tools, working in a shipyard or dry-dock or opting
to take extra time over repairs allows the save to
be made with Advantage, while trying to rush
things would mean making the save with Disadvantage.

How long it takes and how much it costs is up to
the Referee, but typically each repair roll will take
2d6+6 hours and cost 1d6% of the vehicle’s original
cost. The Referee should also determine if all
the necessary parts are available and, if not, how
they can be obtained.

### Jury Rigging
In combat or another emergency, it may not be
possible to make repairs that will last, but there
may just be time to jury rig something that works
for as long as is needed.

Make an Intelligence Save with a TN of 15 to restore
one Hull point, one Quality point or a single
damaged system. The repair lasts for 1d6 rounds,
plus an extra 1d6 rounds if you elect to take the
roll at Disadvantage.

Example: The Century Eagle’s shields have been
knocked out from a direct hit and it’s down to only
5 Hull Points - probably not enough to survive another
hit. Duke Starkiller tries to jury-rig the shield
generator by making an Intelligence Save, electing
to make it at Disadvantage for an extra 1d6
rounds. He rolls a 13 (Disadvantage, low roll), +3
for his Intelligence for a total of 16 - success!
Rolling 2d6, the temporary repairs will keep the
shields working for another 7 rounds, after which it
may be time to check whether the escape pod is
still operational.

### Scale
There are four scales: Character, Vehicle, Starship
and Mega. Character is the scale of Player Characters
(duh), NPCs and most creatures and aliens
as well as most vehicles carrying about 4 to 6 people.
Vehicle is the scale of most planet bound vehicles
like tanks, helicopters, planes and (wet)
ships. Starship scale includes starships of almost
any size from starfighters to capital ships. Mega
scale includes anything bigger than most capital
ships, including space stations and small planetoid-sized battle stations.
Use the following table to determine attack and
damage modifiers.
Either way, a Critical Hit counts as a Critical Hit -
after all, it’s always possible to hit that two meter
wide exhaust port.
Example: Firing a blaster rifle (d10 character damage)
at a tank would attack with Advantage but
only does d10/2 (0-5) damage, against which the
tank still gets its Armour and Shields. A starship
railgun firing at a tank would attack at Disadvantage
but do 2-24 damage (d12 for the railgun, doubled).
Yes, it’s nasty - don’t get hit.
Crew Actions
Pilots maneuver their vehicles in hopes of avoiding
enemy fire or to position the ship for the perfect
shot. Technicians have their hands full jury
rigging repairs, trying to keep systems running or
boosting the engines for a desperate escape.
Gunners, besides trying to blast the enemy to bits
and pieces, may need to lock onto a target before
trying to shoot them with a valuable but devastating
torpedo, or try to restart the Tactical systems if
they go offline. Communication officers may need
to contact help, or try to jam the comm systems or
scanners of rival ships.
The following are just some of the actions a vehicle’s
crew can take, the Referee may allow others.
AttackS
Make an opposed save, Tactical vs Maneuvering,
to engage an enemy ship with one or more
weapons.
Boost Shields
Temporarily increase a vehicles shields by redirecting
power from other systems. The character
makes an Intelligence Save with a TN of 15 plus
the amount they want to improve the Shield score
by (up to the maximum of it’s normal Shield score,
effectively doubling it). This lasts for 1d6 rounds.
One other shipboard system becomes inoperative
or unusable for the same period of time. On a critical
failure, immediately reduce the Quality of the
vehicle by one point.
Example: Manny Lonestar tries to boost the
shields of the Century Eagle. He elects to increase
the normal rating of 3 by an additional 3 points
(the maximum), so must make an Intelligence
Save against a TN of 18 (15+3). Stunningly, he
makes it, and the improvement lasts for 3 rounds -
but the lights in the sickbay go out.
Boost Engines
Redirect the vehicle’s energy reserves to boost its
engines temporarily. To do this the character
makes an Intelligence Save with a TN of 15 plus
the amount they want to increase the vehicle’s
Maneuvering rating by (up to the maximum of it’s
normal score, effectively doubling it). This lasts for
1d6 rounds.
One other shipboard system becomes inoperative
or unusable for the same period of time. On a critical
failure, immediately reduce the Quality of the
vehicle by one point.
Example: Not making any headway against the
imperial fighters gaining on him, Manny decides to
boost the Eagle’s engines. He makes an Intelligence
Save against a TN of 18 (15+3) and for the
next d6 rounds the Eagle’s Maneuvering of 13/+3
becomes 16/+6 - but the Life Support failure alarm
goes off.
Boost Weapons
Redirect the vehicle’s energy reserves to temporarily
improve the power of a vehicle’s guns. Make
an Intelligence Save with a TN 15 plus the number
of guns affected. Increase the weapon damage by
1 die of it’s usual type (eg: if the weapon does
1d10 damage, it now does 2d10, if 1d6, it’s now
2d6). This lasts for 1d6 rounds, no longer.
One other shipboard system becomes inoperative
or unusable for the same period of time. On a critical
failure, immediately reduce the Quality of the
vehicle by one point.
Dodge and Jink
A pilot can perform sudden, chaotic maneuvers in
order to avoid enemy fire. The pilot decides how
many points of additional TN they want to impose
on an enemy attack and must pass a Maneuvering
Save with the same TN penalty.
If the roll is successful enemies attacking them
have the TN of their attacks increased until the
start of the pilot’s next turn. Failure means that not
only are the enemy’s attacks not affected, but attacks
made by the pilot’s own ship are increased
by the penalty amount.
Example: Manny Lonestar is trying to evade imperial
fighters in the Century Eagle. He elects to
make a Maneuvering save at +3, for a total TN of
18 (15+3). Rolling 1d20 plus the Eagle’s Maneuvering
of 16/+6 (which is lower than Manny’s Dexterity
of 17/+7), he gets a total of 17 - failure. Until
Manny’s next turn, Duke Starkiller’s attempts to
shoot at the attacking fighters are made at +3 TN
but the fighters shooting back are unaffected.
Scale Difference Attack at... With the effect...
Three Lower Disadvantage, complete destruction
Two Lower Disadvantage, 10 times damage
One Lower Disadvantage, double damage
Same Normal roll, normal damage
One Higher Advantage, half damage
Two Higher Advantage, 1/10th damage, round down
Three Higher Advantage, no damage but they do notice you
Jam CommS or Scanners
A character operating the communication or scanner
systems may try to jam an enemy ship’s systems
by making an Intelligence Save with a TN of
1.  If successful this action makes the target ship
unable to communicate as long as that character
keeps jamming their channels; any attempts to
use scanners, Lock on Target or attack by that
ship are made at Disadvantage.
Requires the vehicle to be equipped with an ECM
Array.
Lock on Target
Gunners can spend a full round locking their vehicle’s
targeting system to a specific target.
When firing Direct Fire weapons, make a Tactical
Save and forgo all other actions that round, then
next turn make an attack against the specified target
with Advantage, or attack with Disadvantage to
score an automatic Critical Hit against a specific
vehicle system (ignoring armour and shields).
When firing Fire-and-Forget weapons, make a
Tactical Save and forgo all other actions that
round. If a lock-on is achieved, the weapon may
be fired as an action in a later round, provided the
lock is maintained.
If the target’s pilot takes a successful Dodge action
or otherwise increases their Maneuvering
value before the attack can hit, they break the target
lock. Gunners must re-roll the lock-on save immediately,
using the new Maneuvering value as
the TN or lose the target lock.
As long as the weapon has a target lock at the
point it reaches the target (even if it has lost and
re-acquired that lock in between), it will hit. The
referee will rule when a weapon has exceeded its
maximum flight time.
Example: Duke Starkiller makes his Intelligence
Save and manages to lock the Century Eagle’s
proton torpedoes onto Garth Madeup’s fighter. Before
he can fire in the next round, Garth dodges
and manages to increase his ship’s Maneuver rating
from 13/+3 to 15/+5. Duke must re-roll his
lock-on immediately, but scores only 14. Garth has
broken the lock and Duke must try again as a new
action before he can fire the torpedoes.
Plot a Course
The Pilot or Navigator makes an Intelligence Save
to calculate an FTL course and lock it into the
helm navigation computer. At any point after that,
the ship can activate it’s FTL drive. The roll may
be made at Advantage if extra time is taken, at
Disadvantage if it’s rushed.
The Referee can rule that this only takes one turn,
or may decide on longer, but typically 1d4 or 1d6
turns are appropriate. The Pilot or Navigator can
take no other actions while plotting a course. If
they do, they must start over.
Ram
In a desperate move, a pilot can attempt to take
out another vehicle by ramming it without suffering
too much damage themselves.
Make a Maneuvering Save against the target’s
Maneuvering to hit, inflicting half the ramming vehicle’s
normal maximum Hull Points in damage on
both vehicles. Armour and shields will reduce this
damage for both vehicles.
